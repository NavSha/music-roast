{"artist": "Taylor Swift", "title": "Anti-Hero", "lyrics": "I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser\r\nMidnights become my afternoons\r\nWhen my depression works the graveyard shift\r\nAll of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room\r\nI should not be left to my own devices\n\nThey come with prices and vices\n\nI end up in crisis\n\nI've realized all this time\n\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\n\nOne day I'll watch as you're leaving\n\nCuz you got tired of my scheming\n\nFor the last time\n\n\n\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n\nAt tea time, everybody agrees\n\nI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\n\nIt must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\n\nAnd I'm a monster on the hill\n\nToo big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city\n\nPierced through the heart, but never killed\n\n\n\nDid you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism\n\nLike some kind of congressman\n\nI wake up screaming from dreaming\n\nOne day I'll watch as you're leaving\n\nAnd life will lose all of its meaning\n\nFor the last time\n\n\n\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n\nAt tea time, everybody agrees\n\nI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\n\nIt must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero\n\n\n\nI have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money\n\nShe thinks I left them in the will\n\nThe family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out\n\n\"She's laughing up at us from hell!\"\n\n\n\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n\nIt's me, hi, everybody agrees\n\nEverybody agrees...\n\n\n\nIt's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\n\nEverybody agrees\n\nI'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\n\nIt must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero"}
