{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "A 3, because even a broken clock gives you better decision-making twice a day.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the opening crime against logic: 'I threw a wish in the well, don't ask me I'll never tell' \u2014 then IMMEDIATELY tells us she looked at him while it fell. Congratulations, you've created the world's fastest broken promise. It took you literally one line to contradict yourself. That's not mysterious, that's just bad memory. And 'now you're in my way'? Girl, YOU threw the wish! YOU looked at him! He's standing there minding his business with his ripped jeans while you're out here weaponizing pennies and playing Faust over a crush, claiming you'd 'trade my soul for a wish.' The Devil's reading this contract going, 'Nah, I'm good, this liability is too messy even for Hell.'\n\nThen we hit the chorus, the auditory equivalent of a restraining order waiting to happen. 'Hey I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my number so call me maybe' \u2014 MAYBE? You just offered to trade your SOUL two verses ago, and now we're at MAYBE? Pick a commitment level! You're out here doing emotional whiplash Olympics. 'It's hard to look right at you baby' \u2014 yeah, probably because you're too busy scribbling your number on every napkin within a five-mile radius while your pupils turn into slot machine cherries. And that flex about 'all the other boys try to chase me'? Sure, Jan. Nothing screams 'I'm a catch' like begging, borrowing, and stealing (your words!) for someone who 'gave me nothing at all but still you're in my way.' That's not romance, that's a traffic violation.\n\nBut the crown jewel of psychological horror is 'Before you came into my life I missed you so bad.' Read that again. BEFORE. YOU. CAME. INTO. MY. LIFE. You missed someone you hadn't met yet? That's not love at first sight, that's a diagnosis! You're out here retroactively mourning a stranger like some kind of temporal romantic predator. 'I missed you so so bad' \u2014 she says it FOUR TIMES because apparently once wasn't unhinged enough. This isn't a love song, it's a manifesto. Someone check her hard drive for a conspiracy board with red string connecting his ripped jeans to the Illuminati.\n\nThe whole song is basically 'I have no boundaries, severe attachment issues, and the self-awareness of a golden retriever on meth, but here's my number, MAYBE call me.' The 'maybe' is doing more heavy lifting than a forklift at a piano factory, trying desperately to make this sound casual when the entire song is screaming 'I WILL FIND YOU' in glitter pen. This is what happens when Fatal Attraction gets rewritten by someone who thinks wells grant wishes and logic is just a suggestion.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Love at first sight", "quip": "More like 'restraining order at first sight' with this level of instant obsession"}, {"cliche": "Wishing in a well", "quip": "The well should've wished for better decision-making"}, {"cliche": "Trading souls for love", "quip": "Even Ursula the Sea Witch would pass on this desperate contract"}, {"cliche": "Ripped jeans as peak attractiveness", "quip": "Nothing says 'soulmate' like visible knees and denim damage"}, {"cliche": "Playing hard to get with 'maybe'", "quip": "You can't play hard to get when you've already played easy to stalk"}, {"cliche": "Other people want me too", "quip": "The ultimate defense mechanism: 'I'm totally desired by others' while begging one dude to text back"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad", "crime": "Defying the space-time continuum and basic logic", "sentence": "Mandatory physics class and a calendar to understand how time works"}, {"line": "I trade my soul for a wish, pennies and dimes for a kiss", "crime": "Catastrophic negotiation skills and soul-market inflation", "sentence": "Banned from all future haggling and supernatural transactions"}, {"line": "You gave me nothing at all, but still you're in my way", "crime": "Blaming someone for existing near you after YOU initiated everything", "sentence": "Court-mandated therapy for boundary recognition"}, {"line": "I beg and borrow and steal, at first sight and it's real", "crime": "Admitting to potential felonies for a crush and calling it romance", "sentence": "Community service and a restraining order from all wishing wells"}, {"line": "Don't ask me I'll never tell / I looked to you as it fell", "crime": "Setting a world record for fastest self-contradiction", "sentence": "Enrolled in a basic consistency workshop and a memory retention program"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this is an allegory about capitalism's false promises \u2014 the well represents the economy, the wish is trickle-down economics, and 'call me maybe' is the government's response to economic inequality.
