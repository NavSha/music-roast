{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "Four points for rhyming 'me' with 'me' and somehow making millions doing it.", "the_roast": "Let's address the elephant in the room, or should I say, the 'shape' in the song: Ed's opened with perhaps the most groundbreaking revelation since water was discovered to be wet \u2014 'The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go.' Ah yes, because the bar, famously located in a completely different dimension from the club, is where true romance blossoms between shots that make you 'talk slow.' That's not romance, Ed, that's a concussion.\n\nThe real crime here is the thesis statement repeated approximately 47 times: 'I'm in love with your body.' Not your mind, not your personality, not even your taste in Van Morrison \u2014 just your body. And in case we didn't get it the first dozen times, Ed helpfully reminds us with 'I'm in love with the shape of you,' because apparently body and shape are legally distinct concepts in Sheeran's world. The whole song reads like someone trying to hit a word count on an essay about objectification but making it catchy.\n\nThen we get to the date, which sounds like it was planned by two broke college students who discovered a Golden Corral coupon: 'You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat, fill up your bag and I fill up a plate.' Nothing says 'I'm in love with your body' quite like stealing breadsticks in a to-go bag. And they 'talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour' \u2014 which is either profound philosophical discourse or literally just discussing the sauces at the buffet. The magnetic poetry continues with 'we push and pull like a magnet do,' a simile so scientifically accurate it would make your middle school English teacher weep.\n\nThe bridge descends into what can only be described as a printer jam of the phrase 'come on, be my baby, come on' repeated sixteen times. SIXTEEN. At this point, Ed's not writing lyrics; he's casting a summoning spell. If you play this part backwards, it probably just says 'come on, be my baby, come on' but in a spooky voice.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Love at first sight in a bar", "quip": "Revolutionary.
