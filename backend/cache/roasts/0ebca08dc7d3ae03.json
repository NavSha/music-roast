{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "A three, because even a broken clock that mumbles incoherently is right twice a day.", "the_roast": "Kurt Cobain wrote these lyrics like he was playing Mad Libs during a power outage after huffing paint thinner. 'Load up on guns, bring your friends / It's fun to lose and to pretend' \u2014 congratulations, you've created the world's most confusing birthday party invitation. And what exactly is this dirty word that's so shocking? 'Moist'? 'Panties'? The suspense is killing me slower than this song's coherence.\n\nLet's talk about the chorus, which asks 'Hello, hello, hello, how low?' TWELVE TIMES like a broken answering machine having an existential crisis. We get it, Kurt \u2014 you're checking the limbo bar of human despair. But asking the same question a dozen times isn't philosophy, it's just forgetting you already asked. Then we get 'I feel stupid and contagious' \u2014 finally, some self-awareness! Yes, stupidity IS contagious, and these lyrics are Patient Zero of a global pandemic of nonsense.\n\nThe bridge is where things really fall apart like a house of cards in a hurricane. 'A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido' \u2014 this reads like someone's grocery list after a severe head injury. What do these four things have in common? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. It's like Kurt pointed at random words in a dictionary while riding a mechanical bull. This isn't poetic ambiguity; it's just throwing nouns at the wall and seeing what sticks. Spoiler alert: none of it stuck.\n\n'I'm worse at what I do best' \u2014 Kurt, buddy, if what you do best is writing coherent lyrics, then this line is the most honest thing you've ever written. 'And I forget just why I taste / Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile' \u2014 forget why you TASTE? Are you eating yourself? Is this secret cannibalism? And then, the piece de r\u00e9sistance: 'Oh well, whatever, never mind' \u2014 which is basically Kurt admitting he gave up on making sense halfway through and hoped we wouldn't notice. We noticed, Kurt. We all noticed.\n\nThe ending is just screaming 'A denial!' nine times like a toddler who doesn't want to go to bed. This isn't a clever commentary on youth alienation \u2014 it's what happens when your lyric sheet is due in five minutes and you've only got one word left in your vocabulary. The entire song reads like a ransom note assembled by someone who's never seen words before, just pictures of words. Generation X didn't embrace this as their anthem because it spoke to them; they embraced it because it was the only thing more confused than they were.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Asking rhetorical questions repeatedly", "quip": "Asking 'how low' twelve times isn't deep, it's just bad at math"}, {"cliche": "Random nihilistic 'whatever' attitude", "quip": "'Whatever, never mind' is the white flag of lyric writing"}, {"cliche": "Vague rebellion imagery with guns", "quip": "Nothing says teen angst like inviting your friends to a weapons party"}, {"cliche": "Self-deprecating 'I'm so stupid' routine", "quip": "When you write 'I feel stupid,' that's not a mood, that's a confession"}, {"cliche": "Meaningless repetition masquerading as emphasis", "quip": "Saying 'a denial' nine times doesn't make it profound, it makes it a copyright infringement on the word 'denial'"}, {"cliche": "Pretending random word salad is poetry", "quip": "Mulatto, albino, mosquito, libido \u2014 this isn't poetry, it's a failed game of Boggle"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "She's over bored and self assured / Oh no, I know a dirty word", "crime": "Following a character observation with completely unrelated shock about profanity, like a sitcom with ADHD", "sentence": "Sentenced to writing a coherent transition for once in your life"}, {"line": "A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido", "crime": "First-degree random noun assault with intent to confuse", "sentence": "Must attend remedial poetry class and learn that rhyming isn't the same as meaning"}, {"line": "I'm worse at what I do best / And for this gift I feel blessed", "crime": "Creating a paradox so stupid it collapses in on itself like a dying star", "sentence": "Required to explain this logic to a panel of philosophers who will laugh you out of the room"}, {"line": "And I forget just why I taste", "crime": "Writing a line so bizarre it requires a medical consultation", "sentence": "Must provide evidence you understand how human senses work"}, {"line": "A denial!
