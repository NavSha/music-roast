{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "This song has the lyrical depth of a motivational poster in a dentist's waiting room, written by someone who just discovered the copy-paste function.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the elephant convulsing in the room: this song says 'shake' SEVENTY-EIGHT TIMES. That's not a chorus, that's a neurological condition. I've seen Parkinson's patients with more restraint. The lyrical equivalent of watching someone hit the same piano key for three minutes while insisting it's a symphony. Beethoven is rolling over so hard in his grave he's generating renewable energy.\n\nThe opening confession 'Got nothing in my brain / That's what people say' isn't a criticism to defend against\u2014it's apparently the mission statement. This is followed by the revolutionary insight that 'players gonna play' and 'haters gonna hate,' which is about as profound as saying 'breathers gonna breathe' or 'existers gonna exist.' Congratulations, you've discovered tautology and decided to repeat it five times per line in case we were too stupid to grasp the concept of people doing things they do. It's like a philosophical thesis written by a Magic 8-Ball with a concussion.\n\nThe bridge offers us 'this sick beat,' which is particularly bold considering the lyrics have the complexity of a See-Spot-Run book. 'My ex-man bought his new girlfriend' is grammatically having an identity crisis\u2014did he buy her at Costco? And the 'fella over there with the hella good hair' line sounds like it was workshopped at a middle school dance by someone who just learned the word 'hella' exists. The entire song reads like what an AI would generate if you fed it nothing but fortune cookies and Instagram captions from 2014.\n\nBut the real crime is the audacious 'I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet'\u2014immediately followed by admitting to just making moves up as you go. That's not lightning, that's a drunk giraffe on roller skates. The whole track is basically just three different ways to say 'I don't care what you think' repeated until your brain develops Stockholm syndrome and starts believing repetition equals substance.
