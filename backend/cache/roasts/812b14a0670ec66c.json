{"overall_score": 7, "overall_score_comment": "It's catchy enough to make commitment-phobes sweat at weddings for over a decade, so something worked.", "the_roast": "Look, I appreciate the confidence, but this entire song is basically a three-year relationship condensed into one very passive-aggressive Post-It note left on the fridge. 'Cried my tears for three good years' and your big takeaway is... jewelry acquisition protocol? That's some very specific relationship counseling. The whole thesis here is 'if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it,' which is essentially turning marriage proposals into a Finders Keepers situation. Like, sorry babe, you didn't call dibs fast enough, now I'm someone else's problem!\n\nThe lyrical journey takes us from breakup to club to immediate rebound with the speed of someone who definitely hasn't processed their feelings. 'Up in the club, just broke up, I'm doing my own little thing' \u2014 and by 'own little thing' you mean immediately getting 'up on him' while he's 'up on me'? That's not healing, that's just strategic pettiness with a bassline. And can we talk about 'I could care less what you think' which means you DO care at least a little? The phrase is 'couldn't care less,' but I guess grammatical accuracy doesn't fit as well in Dereon jeans.\n\nThen we get the bridge about not wanting 'things of the world' and preferring love, which is sweet except the entire song up until that point has been about wanting a very specific THING of the world \u2014 a ring! Pick a lane! Are we materialistic or are we deep? You can't spend four minutes establishing that rings = commitment = validation and then be like 'I'm not about material things.' That's like ordering a pizza and then giving a speech about how you're really more of a salad person. And 'to infinity and beyond' \u2014 ma'am, that's a Buzz Lightyear quote.
