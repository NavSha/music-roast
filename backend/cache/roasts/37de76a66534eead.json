{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "A 3 out of 10 \u2013 the same score you'd get on a commitment if your only promise was 'never gonna' do basic human decency.", "the_roast": "Let's address the elephant in the room: Rick wrote a song where the ENTIRE hook is just a list of things he won't do. Not things he WILL do \u2013 things he WON'T do. That's like proposing to someone by saying 'I promise not to steal your kidney!' Congratulations, Rick, you've set the bar so low it's basically a tripping hazard in hell. 'Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down' \u2013 buddy, that's not romance, that's the bare minimum requirements for not being a restraining order waiting to happen.\n\nAnd can we talk about 'We're no strangers to love / You know the rules and so do I'? What rules, Rick? What RULES? Did I miss the Geneva Convention on Dating? Is there a rulebook? Because opening your love song with 'you know the bureaucratic regulations of romance' is about as sexy as reading Terms & Conditions out loud on a first date. Then he hits us with 'A full commitment's what I'm thinking of / You wouldn't get this from any other guy.' Oh REALLY? Because every guy from here to Timbuktu has promised commitment. You're not special, Rick. You're basically showing up to a potluck with store-bought potato salad and acting like you invented cuisine.\n\nThe narcissism in 'Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it / Inside, we both know what's been going on' is STUNNING. He's literally telling this woman how SHE feels and what SHE knows. That's not romantic intuition, Rick \u2013 that's gaslighting with a synthesizer. 'We know the game, and we're gonna play it'? What game? Monopoly? Russian Roulette? Emotional manipulation bingo? The man is so vague he makes fortune cookies look like doctoral dissertations.\n\nBut the real crime is the repetition. The chorus appears SEVENTEEN TIMES if you count all the variations. Rick said 'never gonna give you up' so many times that by the end, you're actually BEGGING him to give you up just to hear something new. It's like being held hostage by the world's most optimistic parrot. The song is 3 minutes and 33 seconds of Rick essentially saying 'I'm not a terrible person' on loop until you develop Stockholm Syndrome. And that 'Ooh (Give you up)' breakdown near the end? That's not a musical interlude \u2013 that's the sound of the English language filing for divorce.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "We're no strangers to love", "quip": "Thanks for clarifying you've heard of love, Rick.

Deep down, Rick is teaching us that the ultimate commitment is just... not being awful? Revolutionary.", "final_verdict": "This song is the lyrical equivalent of a participation trophy \u2013 it celebrates the absolute bare minimum of human decency and expects a standing ovation.
