{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "It's like a self-help seminar collided with a Hallmark card aisle and decided to become a pop song.", "the_roast": "Ah yes, 'Flowers' \u2014 the anthem for everyone who's discovered they can function as an adult without a partner. Groundbreaking. The opening lines promise something poetic with 'We were good, we were gold / Kind of dream that can't be sold,' but then we immediately crash into 'Built a home and watched it burn,' which is less metaphor and more arson confession. The dramatic shift from gold dreams to literal pyromania happens so fast I got whiplash.\n\nBut the real comedic gold is in the chorus, where our protagonist discovers the revolutionary concept of... doing things alone. 'I can buy myself flowers' \u2014 congratulations, you've discovered capitalism! 'Write my name in the sand' \u2014 ah yes, that'll show him when the tide comes in and erases it in 30 seconds, really cementing your independence there. And 'Talk to myself for hours / Say things you don't understand' is apparently empowering now? That's not self-love, that's either a therapy session or the beginning of a psychological thriller. The line 'I can hold my own hand' is particularly tragic \u2014 it's like the loneliest high-five in history.\n\nThe bridge tries to add depth with 'Paint my nails cherry red / Match the roses that you left,' which sounds romantic until you realize she's literally color-coordinating her manicure to her ex's guilt flowers like some kind of breakup interior designer. 'No remorse, no regret / I forget every word you said' \u2014 sure, Jan, that's why you wrote an entire song about it and repeat 'I can love me better than you can' approximately 47 times. Nothing says 'I'm totally over it' like recording, producing, and marketing your emotional independence to millions of people.\n\nThe repetition of the chorus is so relentless that by the end, I'm half-convinced this is actually a hypnosis track designed to program the listener into buying their own flowers. The song essentially boils down to: 'I was sad, but then I remembered I have a credit card and can entertain myself.' Which, honestly, is the most realistic breakup anthem we've gotten in years \u2014 just not for the reasons the song thinks it is.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "House/relationship burned down metaphor", "quip": "Another burnt house metaphor?
