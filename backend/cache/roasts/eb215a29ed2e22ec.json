{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "It's like someone wrote a post-apocalyptic anthem after binge-watching every dystopian movie trailer from 2012.", "the_roast": "Let's talk about our protagonist who's apparently \"waking up to ash and dust\" but somehow still has the energy to sweat rust. Friend, if you're sweating rust, you don't need a revolution\u2014you need a tetanus shot and a trip to urgent care. The imagery here is trying SO hard to be edgy that it accidentally created a health and safety violation.\n\nThe whole 'prison bus to the apocalypse' thing is a vibe, I'll give you that, but then we pivot to \"I raise my flags, dye my clothes, it's a revolution, I suppose.\" I SUPPOSE? My guy, you can't casually 'suppose' your way into overthrowing society! That's the most noncommittal revolutionary battle cry since someone said 'let's maybe storm the Bastille if everyone's cool with it?' You're literally painting yourself red to 'fit right in' to your own revolution, which feels like you're joining a rebellion for the aesthetic more than the actual cause.\n\nAnd can we address the elephant in the fallout shelter? This song says \"I'm waking up\" and \"I feel it in my bones\" approximately 47 times. We get it! You're awake! Your bones have feelings! At some point, this stops being an anthem and starts sounding like someone who refuses to get out of bed but wants credit for being conscious. The repetition of \"welcome to the new age\" makes me feel like I'm trapped in a timeshare presentation hosted by a radioactive motivational speaker.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Apocalyptic imagery as a metaphor for personal change", "quip": "Because nothing says 'I'm going through stuff' like nuclear fallout"}, {"cliche": "Feeling it 'in my bones'", "quip": "The bones are the feelings warehouse, apparently"}, {"cliche": "Waking up as transformation", "quip": "Just once I'd love a song about staying comfortably asleep through change"}, {"cliche": "Revolution/rebellion that's super vague", "quip": "Revolting against... something... maybe... if that's cool?"}, {"cliche": "The dramatic 'This is it' declaration", "quip": "Narrator: It was, in fact, not 'it'"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust", "crime": "Biological impossibility posing as poetry", "sentence": "Mandatory science class retake and a multivitamin subscription"}, {"line": "I raise my flags, dye my clothes, it's a revolution, I suppose", "crime": "Most lukewarm call to arms in history", "sentence": "Banned from all future uprisings for lack of commitment"}, {"line": "We're painted red to fit right in", "crime": "Revolutionary conformity\u2014the ultimate oxymoron", "sentence": "Must write 'I will not peer pressure myself' 100 times"}, {"line": "Enough to make my system blow", "crime": "Vague threat that sounds like indigestion", "sentence": "Prescription-strength antacid and a nap"}, {"line": "Woah-oh, woah (x infinity)", "crime": "Padding the word count like a desperate college essay", "sentence": "Thesaurus, immediately"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this is an allegory for someone who hit snooze too many times and now they're late for their first day leading the resistance.
