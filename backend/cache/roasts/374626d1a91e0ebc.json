{"overall_score": 7, "overall_score_comment": "Like a prog-rock fever dream written during a Mercury retrograde while someone simultaneously read the Bible, a physics textbook, and an Italian opera libretto.", "the_roast": "Let me get this straight: Freddie opens with philosophical questions deeper than a college freshman's first bong hit, immediately declares he's a 'poor boy' who needs no sympathy, then proceeds to demand ALL the sympathy for the next six minutes. Pick a lane, buddy. You can't be the stoic 'anyway the wind blows' guy AND the 'Mama, ooo, didn't mean to make you cry' guy. That's emotional whiplash with a guitar solo.\n\nThen we get the confession: 'Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead.' Congratulations, you've just admitted to first-degree murder in the most casual way possible, like you're telling your mom you forgot to take out the trash. 'Life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away' \u2014 yeah, that's generally what happens when you commit homicide, Sherlock. The victim's life had probably just begun too, but nobody's writing a six-minute operatic opus about HIM.\n\nAnd THEN \u2014 because apparently one genre wasn't enough to contain this lyrical chaos \u2014 we pivot to what I can only describe as a theatrical trial conducted by Italian astronomers and Islamic angels having a custody battle. 'Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the fandango?' Sir, you just confessed to murder. This is NOT the time for flamenco dancing lessons. The 'Galileo' section sounds like someone pocket-dialed during a Renaissance fair while having a panic attack. Five Galileos, a Figaro, a magnifico, and a Bismillah walk into a bar \u2014 that's not a joke setup, that's apparently just Tuesday for Queen.\n\nThe emotional arc here is more confusing than IKEA instructions written in Klingon. We go from murder confession to existential dread to opera audition to suddenly getting MAD at someone? 'So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?' \u2014 who are you even talking to now? The murder victim? Galileo? Your poor mother who's been emotionally terrorized for three verses? And after all this drama, the conclusion is 'nothing really matters.' THEN WHY DID YOU JUST TAKE US ON THIS SIX-MINUTE PSYCHEDELIC GUILT TRIP? That's like inviting someone to a seven-course meal and then saying 'food is meaningless anyway.' Buddy, I just sat through your operatic criminal confession \u2014 it better matter!", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Mama, I've done something bad", "quip": "Every dramatic ballad's favorite trope: traumatizing your mother for vocal effect"}, {"cliche": "Nothing really matters / anyway the wind blows", "quip": "The nihilistic shrug \u2014 because when you can't resolve your narrative, just philosophically give up"}, {"cliche": "I'm just a poor boy", "quip": "Mentioned twice, as if poverty excuses opera-level melodrama and casual homicide"}, {"cliche": "Open your eyes / look up to the skies", "quip": "The mandatory 'be enlightened' instruction manual that every pseudo-deep song includes"}, {"cliche": "I don't want to die / wish I'd never been born", "quip": "Can't decide between death wish and birth regret, so why not traumatize listeners with both?"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead", "crime": "Confessing to premeditated murder with the emotional weight of reporting a fender bender", "sentence": "Mandatory songwriting class on how tone and content should maybe match"}, {"line": "Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango / Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me", "crime": "Word salad disguised as profundity \u2014 throwing random references at the wall to see what sticks", "sentence": "Five years of explaining what this actually means to every confused listener"}, {"line": "Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico", "crime": "Summoning historical figures like Pok\u00e9mon without any narrative purpose", "sentence": "Write 'I will not use Italian words just because they sound cool' 500 times"}, {"line": "Bismillah!

The 'anyway the wind blows' refrain? That's just him saying he'll let Yelp reviews decide. It all makes perfect sense if you squint and have recently sustained a head injury.", "final_verdict": "A masterpiece of controlled chaos that somehow convinced the world that murdering someone, name-dropping random historical figures, and shouting 'Bismillah!' seventeen times constitutes lyrical genius. It's like if Shakespeare wrote Hamlet while having a panic attack at a Renaissance fair \u2014 technically brilliant, but also completely unhinged.", "artist": "Queen", "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody", "severity": "medium"}
