{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "This song has all the romantic depth of a Tinder bio written by a malfunctioning chatbot", "the_roast": "Let's start with the opening thesis statement: 'The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go.' Congratulations, you've discovered that moving three feet to the left changes EVERYTHING. This is the geographical enlightenment of someone who thinks International House of Pancakes has worldly cuisine. Then we get the immortal pickup strategy of 'doing shots, drinking faster and then we talk slow' \u2013 nothing says romance like slurred speech and impaired judgment. Really setting the stage for a Nicholas Sparks novel here.\n\nBut the real lyrical felony is this chorus that repeats 'I'm in love with your body' approximately seventeen thousand times. We get it, dude. You like shapes. You sound like a geometry teacher who got way too into his job. 'We push and pull like a magnet do' \u2013 LIKE A MAGNET DO? Did the grammar fairy die? Did subject-verb agreement file a restraining order? And can we talk about 'your love was handmade for somebody like me'? What does that even mean? Was there a Build-A-Love workshop? Did someone crochet this relationship? The metaphor is so confused it needs GPS and therapy.\n\nThe second verse is where things go from lazy to catastrophic. 'You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat, fill up your bag and I fill up a plate' \u2013 ah yes, romance at the Golden Corral, stealing food in a purse. Nothing says 'I'm in love with the shape of you' quite like buffet theft. This is the date that ends with a Yelp review, not a marriage proposal. Then we speedrun through the world's most generic relationship milestones: taxi kiss (check), bed sheets that smell (congratulations on discovering laundry exists?), and 'discovering something brand new' every day, which is code for 'I can't think of actual specific things I like about you.'\n\nAnd finally \u2013 FINALLY \u2013 we arrive at the bridge, which consists entirely of 'Come on, be my baby, come on' repeated until the heat death of the universe. Eight times in a row. EIGHT. This isn't a bridge; it's a hostage negotiation. It's the lyrical equivalent of a toddler tugging on your sleeve at the grocery store. There's more creative wordplay in a parking meter. The whole song reads like it was written by someone who learned about human relationships from watching sitcom opening credits and thought 'Yeah, I can do that, but make it about body shapes and magnets that don't know grammar.'", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Love at the bar/club", "quip": "Because nothing screams 'soulmate' like blurred vision and sticky floors"}, {"cliche": "My bed sheets smell like you", "quip": "This is either romantic or a PSA about doing laundry more frequently"}, {"cliche": "Follow my lead", "quip": "Repeated so many times it's less a dance invitation and more a cult recruitment"}, {"cliche": "Push and pull like magnets", "quip": "The only scientific principle that apparently survived songwriting class"}, {"cliche": "I'm in love with your body", "quip": "Said 847 times in case we thought this might be about personality or shared interests"}, {"cliche": "Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i", "quip": "The sound of a smoke detector running out of batteries, but make it romantic"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "We push and pull like a magnet do", "crime": "Grammatical homicide in the first degree", "sentence": "Mandatory English class retake with a side of shame"}, {"line": "You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat, fill up your bag and I fill up a plate", "crime": "Romanticizing petty larceny at a buffet", "sentence": "Banned from all Golden Corrals in a 50-mile radius"}, {"line": "Come on, be my baby, come on (x8)", "crime": "Lyrical laziness so extreme it violates the Geneva Convention", "sentence": "Forced to write 500 unique sentences without repetition"}, {"line": "Every day discovering something brand new", "crime": "Being aggressively vague while pretending to be deep", "sentence": "Must list 365 actual specific things or admit you're shallow"}, {"line": "Your love was handmade for somebody like me", "crime": "Metaphor manslaughter \u2013 this comparison died on arrival", "sentence": "Take a creative writing class at community college, start with remedial"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this is an elaborate allegory about society's obsession with physical appearance over substance, where the narrator represents late-stage capitalism's reduction of human connection to consumer transactions (see: the buffet stealing).
