Like, sis, you're on Spotify playing on repeat\u2014you're more of a 'Tuesday afternoon at 3pm' than a rare astronomical phenomenon. And 'time is passin' like a solar eclipse'\u2014so, does that mean it's moving incredibly slowly while everyone stares at it through special glasses? Because that's not the flex you think it is.\n\nMy favorite part is the whole 'prove you got the right to please me' energy paired with 'do you practice everything that you preach?' Apparently, this relationship requires both an audition and a theological consistency check. She's not looking for a boyfriend; she's looking for someone to pass a very specific entrance exam. And then there's the classic 'maybe you could cause a girl to change her ways'\u2014ah yes, the timeless tale of 'I'm commitment-phobic but the right person will fix me.'
