{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "It's like a paint-by-numbers romance novel, but someone only used three colors", "the_roast": "Let's start with the opening wisdom: 'The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go.' Ah yes, because nothing says 'better romantic prospects' like moving fifteen feet to the left in the same building. This is like saying 'I don't shop at Target, I shop at Super Target.' Our narrator's master plan involves doing shots until they 'talk slow' \u2013 truly the foundation of every lasting relationship. Shakespeare's Romeo had a balcony scene; Ed's got slurred speech and Van Morrison on a jukebox.\n\nThe chorus hits us with 'We push and pull like a magnet do,' which is technically how magnets work, so points for basic physics, I guess? But then we get hit with the real poetry: 'I'm in love with your body' repeated more times than a fitness influencer's affirmations. We get it, my dude \u2013 you're attracted to someone's physical form. That's not groundbreaking; that's literally how eyes work. The 'oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i' part sounds like someone trying to remember their WiFi password while simultaneously being very excited about geometry.\n\nThe date scene is where things get adorably specific yet somehow still vague. 'You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat, fill up your bag' \u2013 wait, are we stealing from a buffet? Is this a romantic heist? Are we date-night dine-and-dashers? And then 'Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate' creates this beautiful mental image of one person committing buffet larceny while the other plays by the rules. Relationship goals, truly. The bridge then devolves into 'Come on, be my baby, come on' repeated sixteen times, which is the lyrical equivalent of a telemarketer who won't take no for an answer.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Club/bar pickup scene", "quip": "The Venn diagram of these two locations is basically a circle, but sure"}, {"cliche": "Following my lead", "quip": "Mentioned four times, in case you forgot who's allegedly in charge here"}, {"cliche": "Bed sheets smell like you", "quip": "The 'I should probably do laundry' romantic trope"}, {"cliche": "My heart is falling", "quip": "Should probably see a cardiologist about that"}, {"cliche": "Discovering something brand new every day", "quip": "Like how magnets work, apparently"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "We push and pull like a magnet do", "crime": "Making physics sound unromantic and grammatically questionable", "sentence": "Required to retake 8th grade science and explain how ONE magnet pushes and pulls"}, {"line": "Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate", "crime": "Casually suggesting buffet theft as a bonding activity", "sentence": "Banned from all Golden Corrals within a 50-mile radius"}, {"line": "Come on, be my baby, come on (x16)", "quip": "Death by repetition in the first degree", "sentence": "Forced to write 'I will use more than five words' 500 times"}, {"line": "Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i", "crime": "Impersonating a dial-up modem connection", "sentence": "Sentenced to communicate only through interpretive dance for one month"}], "hidden_meanings": "This song is clearly a metaphor for Ed's relationship with basic geometry. He's 'in love with the shape' because he's finally understanding that bodies have three-dimensional forms \u2013 a revelation most of us had in kindergarten. The magnet metaphor represents his struggle with whether opposites attract or likes attract, and he still hasn't figured it out.", "final_verdict": "It's catchy enough to get stuck in your head for three years, but the lyrics have the emotional depth of a kiddie pool. At least he's honest about the body thing, though \u2013 points for transparency, minus points for saying it forty-seven times.", "artist": "Ed Sheeran", "title": "Shape of You", "severity": "mild"}
