'I threw a wish in the well / Don't ask me, I'll never tell' followed immediately by telling us EVERYTHING for the next three minutes. That's not mysterious, that's just bad at keeping secrets. And then she trades her soul for a wish? Girl, you already made the wish in the well! That's double-dipping on the supernatural transaction fees. Pick a lane: are we doing fountain wishes or Faustian bargains?\n\nThe real lyrical masterpiece here is 'Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad.' Let's just pause and appreciate the philosophical quandary of missing someone before you met them. That's not love at first sight, that's a time travel paradox. Did you miss him, or did you miss the IDEA of him? Because those are different things, and one of them requires significantly less therapy. 'I missed you so, so bad'\u2014she says this FOUR times as if repetition will make it make sense. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.\n\nAnd can we address the commitment issues? 'Here's my number, so call me maybe'? MAYBE?! You just told this man you traded your soul and missed him before meeting him, but now it's 'maybe'? That's like proposing marriage and ending with 'if you're not busy.' Either you're willing to make interdimensional wishes for this dude or you're not.
