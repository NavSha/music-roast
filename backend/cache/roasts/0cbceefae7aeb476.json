Ma'am, repeating it doesn't make it true \u2014 that's not how maturity works, that's how manifestation fails. Getting a therapist just to ignore everything they say is honestly peak 2020s energy, like buying a gym membership to take mirror selfies in the parking lot.\n\nThe progression from 'hate to see you happy' to full-scale home invasion is the fastest downward spiral since my sourdough starter died. One minute she's salty about seeing him 'with some other broad,' the next she's in the basement planning like she's got blueprints and a Home Depot receipt. And the farmer's market detail? THE FARMER'S MARKET? Nothing says 'premeditated' like knowing his weekend organic produce schedule. 'Your perfect peach' is doing heavy lifting as both a fruit reference and a jealousy trigger \u2014 Gordon Ramsay could never be this pressed about produce.\n\nThe criminal self-awareness is almost impressive. 'This text gon' be evidence' \u2014 girl, this whole SONG is evidence! She's really out here creating a documented confession with a beat, melody, and streaming revenue. The prosecutor won't even need to cross-examine, just hit play on Spotify. And 'Rather be in jail than alone' is the saddest flex since LinkedIn motivational posts. That's not romantic desperation, that's just poor cost-benefit analysis. Prison food, orange jumpsuits, and communal showers because you can't download Hinge?\n\n'I did it all for love... I did all of this sober' \u2014 OH, so you DON'T have an excuse? That's worse! Being sober during your villain origin story isn't the flex you think it is. That's like robbing a bank and being mad people won't praise your financial planning skills. And ending with 'Oops' and '(He left me no choice)' like this is a whoopsie-daisy situation? Forgetting someone's birthday is oops.
