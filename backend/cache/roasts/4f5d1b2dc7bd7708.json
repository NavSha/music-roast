We've got espresso, Nintendo, Mountain Dew, and somehow perfume all in one relationship\u2014this guy's not falling in love, he's being marketed to. When she says 'That's that me espresso,' I'm genuinely concerned she might be describing a caffeine addiction rather than chemistry. Also, 'I Mountain Dew it for ya'? Girl, that's a verb now? I can't tell if she's flirting or pitching a Super Bowl commercial.\n\nThe line 'My give-a-fucks are on vacation' is trying so hard to sound cool and unbothered, but then she spends the entire song explaining exactly how bothered she is with making this guy think about her. Pick a lane! You can't be emotionally unavailable AND wrapping him around your finger while brewing his coffee. That's called having a very available Keurig. And can we talk about 'My twisted humor make him laugh so often'? Bestie, if your humor is so twisted, why are all your jokes just caffeine puns?\n\nThe 'move it up, down, left, right, oh, switch it up like Nintendo' section sounds like she's either giving dance instructions or accidentally read the Konami code out loud. I respect the commitment to keeping this man awake, though\u2014between the espresso references and the gaming console comparisons, sleep truly isn't an option. When she drops 'Holy shit' in the middle like she just realized her own power, I felt that. Even she's surprised this word salad of brand names somehow worked.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Comparing yourself to coffee/being addictive", "quip": "Starbucks has entered the chat and wants royalties"}, {"cliche": "The 'I'm so confident I don't care' paradox", "quip": "If your give-a-fucks are on vacation, why'd you write a whole song about it?"}, {"cliche": "Bragging about making your ex jealous", "quip": "The 'too bad your ex' line is the musical equivalent of subtweet"}, {"cliche": "Using 'baby' as punctuation", "quip": "Baby count: 6.
