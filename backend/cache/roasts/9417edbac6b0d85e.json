{"overall_score": 8, "overall_score_comment": "It's like if Shakespeare had a fever dream during an opera, murdered someone, then forgot what he was talking about halfway through.", "the_roast": "Freddie Mercury walked into the studio and said 'What if we made a song that's three completely different songs having an identity crisis?' And honestly? Respect. We start with 'Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?' which is the most philosophical opening since your buddy got too high at a party and won't stop asking deep questions. But before we can answer, our protagonist casually drops 'Mama, just killed a man' like he's confessing he forgot to buy milk. The emotional whiplash is real.\n\nThe middle section reads like someone's Google search history during a Renaissance Faire panic attack. 'Scaramouch' and 'Fandango' and 'Galileo' are just thrown in there like ingredients in a confused pasta recipe. And can we talk about how they yell 'Galileo' five times? We get it, you know ONE scientist's name. Then 'Bismillah' shows up for no reason except to make every karaoke singer sweat nervously. It's like the lyrical equivalent of opening every drawer in your house while cooking.\n\nBy the end, our murderer is somehow the victim, demanding 'So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?' Sir, YOU killed someone. That was YOUR arc. Now you're mad about being held accountable? The audacity! Then we circle back to 'Nothing really matters' which is either profound nihilism or just gave up trying to make sense. It's the musical equivalent of 'anyway, here's Wonderwall' except it's 'anyway, nothing matters and also I committed homicide.'", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Mama, I killed a man", "quip": "The most dramatic way to tell your mom you messed up since 'I crashed the car'"}, {"cliche": "Nothing really matters", "quip": "The official anthem of philosophy majors and people avoiding their problems"}, {"cliche": "Poor boy, nobody loves me", "quip": "Classic self-pity move\u2014also you KILLED SOMEONE so maybe that's why"}, {"cliche": "I don't want to die / wish I'd never been born", "quip": "Pick a lane, dude, you're clogging up the existential crisis highway"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango", "crime": "Random word salad served without dressing", "sentence": "Must explain to every confused listener what a Scaramouch is (spoiler: nobody knows)"}, {"line": "Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo Figaro", "crime": "Assault by repetition and confusing the scientist with an opera", "sentence": "Take a history class and learn there were other Renaissance figures"}, {"line": "Bismillah!
