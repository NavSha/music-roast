{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "This song has the lyrical depth of a bumper sticker collection from a gas station in 2003.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the absolute audacity of sampling Dionne Warwick's 'Walk On By' just to say 'bitch, I said what I said' over it. That's like using the Mona Lisa as a placemat for your McDonald's. The entire hook is literally 'I'd rather be famous instead' repeated until our ears file for a restraining order. Congratulations on discovering the 'copy-paste' function, truly revolutionary songwriting.\n\nThe verses are a fascinating psychological study in what happens when you throw darts at a board covered in 2010s rap clich\u00e9s. 'She the devil, she a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel' \u2014 oh wow, we've never heard THAT particular combination of words in literally every single hip-hop track since 2015. And then 'she put her foot to the pedal' because apparently we're writing Fast & Furious dialogue now? The rhyme scheme of devil/rebel/pedal/settle is so lazy it's practically in a coma. You could've had a middle schooler write this in detention and they would've at least tried to use a thesaurus.\n\n'I put good dick all in my kidneys' is perhaps the most anatomically confused flex in music history. That's not how any of this works. That's not how any of this has EVER worked. Someone needs to send this to a medical school as an example of what NOT to say about human biology. And then we get 'My illness don't come with no remedy' \u2014 so your illness DOES come with a remedy then? Double negatives aren't just bad grammar, they're accidentally revealing you might actually need help. The whole 'magical foresight' to see yourself 'sleeping in courtside' is peak accidental honesty: yes, we can all foresee you napping at a basketball game because this song is putting us to sleep too.\n\nThe bridge goes full word salad with 'I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?' which sounds like autocorrect had a stroke. And the final plot twist of 'Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more' directly contradicts the ENTIRE SONG where you literally said 'I'd rather be famous instead' 47,000 times. That's not character development, that's just forgetting what you wrote three minutes ago. This song has the narrative consistency of a fever dream and the lyrical sophistication of a fortune cookie written by someone who's never actually experienced fortune.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "She the devil/bad bitch/rebel", "quip": "The holy trinity of every SoundCloud rapper's vocabulary since 2014"}, {"cliche": "I said what I said", "quip": "And then you said it again.

Just kidding \u2014 it's about being famous and saying 'bitch' a lot.

It's a masterclass in saying absolutely nothing with maximum confidence, which honestly?
