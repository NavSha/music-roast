{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "A solid 4 out of 10 \u2014 like Tommy's financial planning skills.", "the_roast": "Let me get this straight: we open with 'Once upon a time, not so long ago' like we're reading a bedtime story about economic depression. Tommy worked on the docks, union's on strike, and his brilliant solution is to... pawn his guitar? That's not 'living on a prayer,' that's living on weaponized optimism and a complete absence of a resume.\n\nMeanwhile, Gina's out here 'working for her man' and 'bringing home her pay,' which sounds less like a love story and more like she's the only functioning adult in this relationship. She's pulling double shifts at the diner while Tommy's at home whispering 'someday' like it's a financial strategy. Newsflash: 'someday' doesn't pay the rent, and neither does a pawned guitar that 'used to make it talk.' What did it say, Tommy? 'Get a job'?\n\nThe chorus insists 'it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not' \u2014 which is exactly the kind of thing you say when you've given up on making it. 'We've got each other and that's a lot' is beautiful until the lights get shut off. And they're only 'halfway there'? Halfway to WHERE? Bankruptcy court? The chorus is basically Stockholm Syndrome set to a killer riff.\n\nThe bridge delivers the absolute gem: 'You live for the fight when it's all that you've got.' Brother, if fighting is ALL you've got, maybe update that LinkedIn profile. This isn't inspirational \u2014 it's a cry for help wrapped in denim and hairspray. The whole song is like a motivational poster written by someone who's never seen a motivational poster work.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Working-class Romeo and Juliet", "quip": "Except instead of dying for love, they're dying from lack of health insurance"}, {"cliche": "Love conquers all", "quip": "Love is great, but have you tried paying your bills?"}, {"cliche": "Hold on to what you've got", "quip": "What they've got is debt and delusion"}, {"cliche": "Take my hand and we'll make it", "quip": "Make it where?
