{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "Like a breakup text that accidentally got sent to your entire contact list \u2014 passionate, repetitive, and nobody's entirely sure what 'rolling in the deep' actually means.", "the_roast": "Let's address the elephant in the room: Adele has a fire starting in her heart that's reaching 'fever pitch.' Ma'am, that's called acid reflux. Get some Tums and stop diagnosing heartburn as heartbreak. And she's so confident this fire is 'bringing her out the dark' \u2014 girl, that's just the glow from your phone while you're stalking his Instagram at 3 AM.\n\nThe real criminal mastermind move here is threatening to 'lay your sheet bare' and 'make your head burn' while simultaneously admitting she'll be 'making a home' in the depths of his despair. So let me get this straight: your post-breakup plan is to become a squatter in your ex's sadness? That's not revenge, that's just rent-free real estate with terrible emotional infrastructure. The HOA fees alone would be catastrophic.\n\nAnd can we talk about 'you had my heart inside of your hand, and you played it to the beat'? What beat? Was he using her heart as a bongo drum? A tambourine? This metaphor is doing more gymnastics than Simone Biles. Either he's a cardiologist with a surprisingly funky bedside manner, or Adele's been dating a very musical serial killer. The whole 'rolling in the deep' thing gets repeated roughly 47,000 times, but nobody \u2014 not even Adele herself, I'd wager \u2014 can explain if we're rolling in the deep end of a pool, the ocean, or just really deep existential regret. It's like she Googled 'profound-sounding phrases' and picked the first one that rhymed with 'beat.'\n\nThe bridge gives us this motivational poster nonsense: 'Throw your soul through every open door, count your blessings to find what you look for.' Excuse me, is this a breakup anthem or a LinkedIn inspirational quote? Did she break up with him or did she just finish reading 'The Secret'? And then 'turn my sorrow into treasured gold' \u2014 congratulations, you've just described the literal plot of Rumpelstiltskin. Your revenge fantasy is a fairy tale about a weird little man who spins straw. The song ends with 'you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat' repeated like a broken record, which is ironic because that's exactly what this entire song is.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Fire starting in my heart", "quip": "Nothing says 'original metaphor' like comparing emotions to combustion \u2014 truly groundbreaking work from the Department of Obvious Imagery"}, {"cliche": "The scars of your love", "quip": "Because apparently love is a back-alley knife fight and everyone's collecting emotional keloids as souvenirs"}, {"cliche": "We could have had it all", "quip": "Ah yes, the mating call of every person who just discovered their ex is happy \u2014 performed here exactly 7,000 times for emphasis"}, {"cliche": "You're gonna wish you never had met me", "quip": "The official slogan of people whose revenge plan is to... continue existing?
