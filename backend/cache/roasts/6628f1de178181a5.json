{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "This reads like a diss track written by a very angry historian who just discovered Google and thinks every metaphor needs a TED Talk.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the elephant in the room: Kendrick really said 'call an amberlamps' in 2024 like we're still watching viral videos from 2010. My guy, that meme is so old it has a mortgage and two kids in college. And 'Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw'? So you're saying your opponents are... easy shots that professionals still somehow miss 25% of the time? That's not the flex you think it is, Kenny.\n\nThe whole 'certified pedophiles' section is basically Kendrick screaming 'I HAVE ALLEGATIONS' for sixteen bars straight like a hip-hop Maury Povich episode. 'Say Drake, I hear you like 'em young' followed by 'hide your lil' sister' \u2013 we get it, you have one angle and you're going to beat it into the ground like a rented mule. Then there's 'Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor' which is admittedly clever until you realize he's so proud of this one pun that he probably workshopped it for three weeks and called his mom to tell her about it.\n\nBut nothing \u2013 and I mean NOTHING \u2013 compares to the trainwreck that is the 'Atlanta is a colonizer' metaphor. Kendrick really looked at a beef with Drake and thought 'You know what this needs? A five-paragraph essay about antebellum railroad construction.' My brother in Christ, this is supposed to be a diss track, not your application to a PhD program in Urban Studies. 'The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer' \u2013 yes, Kendrick, we all took 8th grade social studies. Comparing Drake working with Atlanta rappers to literal slavery and colonization is the kind of reach that would make Mr. Fantastic jealous. You're out here delivering a dissertation when everyone just wanted you to roast the man's ghostwriters.\n\nAnd can we talk about the repetition? 'They not like us' gets repeated so many times I thought my Spotify was glitching. It's like Kendrick discovered the copy-paste function and decided to build his entire hook around it. Then there's 'freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God' chanted like a demonic ritual \u2013 sir, this isn't an exorcism, it's a diss track. The 'OV-ho' call-and-response at the end sounds like a children's birthday party game that went horribly, horribly wrong. 'Are you my friend? Are we locked in?' \u2013 what is this, a therapy session or a rap battle? I half expected him to ask Drake about his feelings and whether he's been drinking enough water.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Using a 14-year-old meme reference ('amberlamps')", "quip": "Nothing says 'I'm culturally relevant' like referencing viral videos from the Obama administration"}, {"cliche": "Comparing yourself to a biblical figure/martyr", "quip": "'Nail a nigga to the cross' \u2013 because nothing screams street credibility like messiah complex"}, {"cliche": "The 'hide your sister/daughter' trope", "quip": "Every diss track writer thinks they invented this line, and they're all equally unoriginal"}, {"cliche": "Repetitive hook as a crutch", "quip": "When you write 'they not like us' 47 times, that's not a hook, that's a hostage situation"}, {"cliche": "Forcing historical/academic metaphors into beef", "quip": "The only thing getting murdered here is your audience's attention span during your Civil War lecture"}, {"cliche": "Owl/bird puns about Drake's OVO", "quip": "Congratulations, you're the 10,000th rapper to make a bird joke about an owl logo \u2013 here's your participation trophy"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "call an amberlamps, tell him 'Breathe, bro'", "crime": "Felony Meme Necromancy", "sentence": "Mandatory viewing of every viral video from 2010-2015 until you understand they're dead, Jim"}, {"line": "The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer / Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda", "crime": "First-Degree Metaphor Murder and Assault with a Deadly Dissertation", "sentence": "Teaching summer school US History until you learn that diss tracks aren't the place for your academic theories"}, {"line": "What OVO for?

The repeated 'they not like us' is actually him trying to convince himself that he's still different from Drake, despite the fact that both of them are wealthy celebrities arguing on tracks that sound increasingly like academic peer review sessions with better production.", "final_verdict": "This track is what happens when someone gives a brilliant rapper too much time to overthink and access to a history textbook. It's one part diss track, two parts dissertation defense, and three parts that one friend who won't let a joke die \u2013 all wrapped up in production so good it almost distracts you from the fact that Kendrick just compared Future collaborating with Drake to actual slavery and expected us to nod along like that made sense.", "artist": "Kendrick Lamar", "title": "Not Like Us", "severity": "savage"}
