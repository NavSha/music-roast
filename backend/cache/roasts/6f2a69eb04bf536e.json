{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "A solid 4/10 \u2014 like a breakup text written by someone who just discovered a thesaurus and a pyromaniac's handbook.", "the_roast": "Oh look, another song about fire in someone's heart. How original! Because when I think 'devastating heartbreak,' I definitely think 'preventable house fire.' 'There's a fire starting in my heart / Reaching a fever pitch' \u2014 congratulations, that's not passion, that's literally the symptoms of cardiac arrest. Call 911, not a songwriter. And what exactly are we 'rolling in the deep' of? Petroleum? Regret? A really deep kiddie pool? The metaphor is so vague it could mean anything from sadness to discovering the Mariana Trench.\n\nLet's talk about 'you had my heart inside of your hand / And you played it to the beat' \u2014 because nothing says romance like someone literally holding your cardiovascular organ and using it as a BONGO DRUM. That's not betrayal, that's a felony and a serious health code violation. Also, 'Baby, I have no story to be told / But I've heard one of you' \u2014 THEN WHY ARE YOU TELLING US A STORY FOR FOUR MINUTES? That's like saying 'I have nothing to say' and then delivering a TED Talk. Pick a lane!\n\nThe threat of 'Think of me in the depths of your despair / Making a home down there' is trying SO hard to be menacing but just sounds like you're moving into his emotional basement without paying rent. You're not haunting him, you're just being a squatter in his psyche. And 'I'm gonna make your head burn'? What are you, a budget Freddy Krueger? That's not vengeance, that's a scalp condition. Maybe throw in some Head & Shoulders with that revenge fantasy.\n\nBut my favorite part is how we 'could have had it all' gets repeated approximately 47,000 times like a broken record of regret. WE GET IT. You could've had it all. You also could've had better lyrics that don't sound like they were written during a smoke alarm test. 'Throw your soul through every open door' \u2014 that's not advice, that's how you lose your soul to door-to-door salesmen. And 'Turn my sorrow into treasured gold'? Congratulations, you've invented emotional alchemy. If only you could turn these clich\u00e9s into something actually profound.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Fire/burning heart metaphor", "quip": "Nothing says 'I'm devastated' like symptoms that should be treated with aspirin and a cardiologist"}, {"cliche": "Scars of love", "quip": "Love gave you emotional scars?
