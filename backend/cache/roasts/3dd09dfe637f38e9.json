That's the lyrical equivalent of ordering a venti and getting three shots of the same joke. The confidence is admirable, but girl, you're out here claiming 'My give-a-fucks are on vacation' while literally writing an entire song about how much this boy is obsessed with you. That's not indifference, that's a TED Talk.\n\nLet's talk about the beverage brand massacre happening in the second verse. 'Mountain Dew it for ya'? 'Morning coffee, brewed it for ya'? 'Brand-newed it for ya'? This reads like a corporate sponsorship deal fell through at the last minute, so she just started freestyling every liquid and verb she could think of. I half expected 'I Gatorade it for ya, I marinated it for ya, I participated for ya.' The 'perfumed it for ya' line is the only one that makes sense, and even that sounds like she's describing a Yankee Candle.\n\nAnd can we address 'Switch it up like Nintendo'? Bestie, are we talking about the console, the game, or are you just out here name-dropping childhood nostalgia hoping millennials will stream? Because moving 'up, down, left, right' sounds less like sexy choreography and more like you're teaching someone the Konami Code. The whole song is basically 'I'm so hot I keep him awake,' which is a great concept until you realize actual espresso also keeps people awake, and nobody writes love songs about their Nespresso machine.
