{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "Like a fortune cookie written by someone who just discovered anxiety \u2014 profound-ish, but we've all read this one before.", "the_roast": "Benson Boone has given us the musical equivalent of bubble wrap: mildly satisfying to pop, but ultimately just air and plastic. The whole song is basically one long 'please don't jinx it' superstition set to piano chords. 'For a while there, it was rough / But lately, I've been doin' better / Than the last four cold Decembers I recall' \u2014 buddy, that's just called growing up. Congratulations on being slightly less miserable than you were during four consecutive holiday seasons. Someone get this man a participation trophy.\n\nThe chorus is essentially Benson standing in the middle of a field screaming 'DON'T TAKE MY STUFF!' at the sky like a toddler who just discovered object permanence. 'I want you, I need you, oh God / Don't take / These beautiful things that I've got' repeats so many times that by the end, even God is probably like, 'Dude, I heard you the first seven times.' It's less of a prayer and more of a contractual negotiation with the universe. The man found a girl his parents love and immediately started catastrophizing like he's in a Greek tragedy. Sir, this is a Wendy's.\n\nAnd can we talk about 'there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you'? That's beautiful in theory, but also... therapy exists. The whole song is just 'I'm happy but what if I'm not happy later?' stretched into three minutes. It's like watching someone win the lottery and immediately start planning their bankruptcy. 'I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane' \u2014 great, now maybe use that mind to practice some gratitude without the constant doomsday footnotes. This song is what happens when intrusive thoughts get a record deal.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Thanking God for sending a romantic partner", "quip": "As if the Almighty is running a celestial dating app with premium features"}, {"cliche": "Cold/sad Decembers representing depression", "quip": "December: officially the saddest month for songwriters who need an easy rhyme with 'remember'"}, {"cliche": "The girl my parents love", "quip": "Nothing says 'true love' like meeting Mom and Dad's approval checklist"}, {"cliche": "Please stay / Don't go", "quip": "The chorus mantra of every breakup song ever, except nobody's even leaving yet"}, {"cliche": "Losing sleep over hypothetical problems", "quip": "Being 'up at night' worrying about good things is just privilege with insomnia"}, {"cliche": "Finding peace and love but still being anxious", "quip": "Modern poetry: I have everything but have you considered... what if I didn't?"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all", "crime": "Defining 'having it all' as parental approval plus sleepovers", "sentence": "Required to read one (1) book about adult life goals"}, {"line": "But I know the things He gives me, He can take away", "crime": "Treating blessings like a divine lending library with aggressive due dates", "sentence": "Must attend one positive thinking seminar without mentioning worst-case scenarios"}, {"line": "If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?", "crime": "Asking the question but offering zero solutions for three entire minutes", "sentence": "Sentenced to actually answer your own rhetorical question in the sequel"}, {"line": "Oh, ooh / Please don't take", "crime": "Using 'oh, ooh' as emotional filler when words are too hard", "sentence": "Mandatory enrollment in Advanced Vocabulary for Feelings 101"}, {"line": "I want you, I need you, oh God", "crime": "Comma splicing your desperation into a run-on plea", "sentence": "Banned from using all three phrases in the same breath for six months"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly, this song is a metaphor for Benson's relationship with his Spotify algorithm \u2014 he's finally made it big, but he's terrified the streaming gods will banish him back to four sad Decembers of zero monthly listeners.
