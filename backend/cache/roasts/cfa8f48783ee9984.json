{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "A solid 4 out of 10: the musical equivalent of bubble wrap \u2013 provides temporary anxiety relief but ultimately just repetitive popping.", "the_roast": "Benson Boone has discovered anxiety and decided to make it everyone's problem through the medium of song. 'For a while there, it was rough / But lately, I've been doin' better / Than the last four cold Decembers I recall' \u2013 my guy is out here treating mental health like a Yelp review: 'Three stars, would recommend over previous Decembers, but still waiting on fries.' The specificity of FOUR Decembers is sending me. Not three, not five \u2013 specifically four cold ones. Were the other months fine? Did September treat you right?\n\nThe entire premise is 'I finally got my life together and now I'm terrified it'll disappear,' which, fair enough, but he's delivered it with all the theological nuance of a guy who just discovered Pascal's Wager at a coffee shop. 'I thank God every day for the girl He sent my way / But I know the things He gives me, He can take away' \u2013 this isn't romance, it's a hostage negotiation with the Almighty. Nothing says 'I love you' quite like 'God could smite this relationship at any moment, so let's cuddle!' His girlfriend must feel SO secure knowing she's essentially a divine loaner car that could get repossessed at any moment.\n\nThen we arrive at the chorus, which I can only describe as aggressive begging set to music. 'Please stay / I want you, I need you, oh God / Don't take / These beautiful things that I've got' repeats so many times that Spotify should classify this as a prayer, not a pop song. The man has condensed his entire emotional spectrum into four phrases and decided to just\u2026 loop them. It's like he's holding the universe at metaphorical gunpoint going 'PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY STUFF' over and over. And that bridge? 'If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?' \u2013 Congratulations, Benson, you've discovered anticipatory anxiety.
