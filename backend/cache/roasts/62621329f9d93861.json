{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "Three points for successfully rhyming words a kindergartener could manage, minus seven for turning anxiety into the world's most melodramatic hostage negotiation with God.", "the_roast": "Let me get this straight: homeboy finally gets his life together after what sounds like four years of seasonal depression and a dysfunctional family situation, meets a girl his parents don't hate, and immediately starts catastrophizing like he's in a Greek tragedy written by someone who just discovered WebMD's anxiety disorder page. 'For a while there, it was rough / But lately, I've been doin' better' \u2014 congratulations on achieving the bare minimum of human functionality, Benson. That's like bragging about finally learning to shower regularly. The fact that seeing your family 'every month' is presented as an achievement is genuinely concerning. What were you doing before? Communicating via carrier pigeon quarterly?\n\nBut the real tragedy here is that this man has weaponized gratitude into the most toxic relationship mindset since Romeo decided stalking was romantic. 'I know the things He gives me, He can take away' \u2014 my dude, that's not faith, that's theological Stockholm syndrome. You're treating happiness like it's a rental car that God might repossess if you miss a prayer payment. And then we get to 'there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you' \u2014 FALSE. There are men terrified of bears, crocodiles, tax audits, and prostate exams. Your manufactured existential dread doesn't win the fear Olympics just because you found a girlfriend your parents approve of.\n\nThe chorus is essentially Benson having a full-blown panic attack set to a piano melody, repeatedly screaming 'PLEASE STAY' like a toddler clinging to their mom's leg at daycare drop-off. 'I want you, I need you, oh God / Don't take / These beautiful things that I've got' \u2014 this isn't a love song, it's a ransom note to the Almighty. The emotional maturity here is roughly equivalent to keeping your happiness in a death grip until it suffocates. And what's with the bridge? 'If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?' BECAUSE YOU WROTE AN ENTIRE SONG ABOUT IT, BENSON. You're not profound; you're just anxious with a record deal.\n\nThe real kicker is 'I've got peace and I've got love / But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all' \u2014 so you DON'T have peace, then? Words mean things, my guy. That's like saying 'I'm totally calm' while rocking in the fetal position. This whole song is the lyrical equivalent of bubble-wrapping your entire life and then being shocked when you can't breathe. Congratulations on turning personal growth into a four-minute exercise in borrowed trauma. Someone get this man some therapy and a journal, because clearly he's mistaken catastrophic thinking for depth.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Thanking God for sending someone your way", "quip": "The divine dating service trope \u2014 because apparently God moonlights as eHarmony's algorithm"}, {"cliche": "Cold Decembers as metaphor for depression", "quip": "Nothing says 'deep' like blaming your mental health on winter four times in a row"}, {"cliche": "Finding your mind/feeling sane", "quip": "Where was it?

The girlfriend is obviously a metaphor for healthcare benefits, and God is middle management. Just kidding \u2014 it's literally just a guy who needs to discover antidepressants and stop treating happiness like it's nitroglycerin.", "final_verdict": "Benson Boone has written the musical equivalent of wrapping yourself in bubble wrap and wondering why you feel suffocated \u2014 a catastrophizing masterclass that mistakes anxiety spirals for emotional depth, delivered with all the healthy attachment style of a barnacle clinging to a sinking ship.
