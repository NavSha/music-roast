{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "A solid 4 out of 10 \u2014 like a college dorm room poet who just discovered nostalgia and financing problems.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the elephant in the Rover: these two broke millennials are having a passionate reunion in the backseat of an SUV 'that I know you can't afford.' Nothing says romance like publicly auditing your ex's credit score mid-hookup. I'm getting mixed signals here \u2014 are we rekindling love or repossessing a vehicle?\n\nThe specificity is both this song's greatest strength and most embarrassing feature. We get a complete inventory of stolen furniture ('the mattress that you stole from your roommate back in Boulder'), geographical references that sound like a sad road trip itinerary, and the revelation that their entire relationship was soundtracked by one Blink-182 song they 'beat to death in Tuscon.' Forget couple's therapy \u2014 these two need a Spotify playlist with more than one track. Also, 'I forget just why I left you, I was insane'? That's not character growth, that's amnesia with commitment issues.\n\nAnd then we have the chorus's desperate mantra: 'We ain't ever getting older' \u2014 repeated approximately 47 times as if saying it enough will stop their student loan interest from compounding. This isn't profound; it's just denial with a drop beat. Spoiler alert: you ARE getting older, and that Rover's warranty definitely expired. The whole song reads like someone trying to romanticize being broke and directionless by adding tattoos and hotel bars. It's giving 'Instagram caption that thinks it's deeper than it is.'", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Moving to 'the city' in a broke down car", "quip": "Which city? Be specific. Is it Tulsa?
