{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "A three, because even a broken clock tells better stories twice a day.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the elephant in the Rover: this entire song reads like a Creative Writing 101 dropout's fever dream about what constitutes 'edgy romance.' 'Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you / I drank too much and that's an issue but I'm okay' \u2013 congratulations, you've just described literally every person who's ever had a Tinder account and a wine mom starter pack. The self-aware alcoholism admission followed immediately by 'but I'm okay' is the lyrical equivalent of texting your ex at 2 AM with 'you up?' and then adding 'just checking on you as a friend.'\n\nThe specificity is trying SO HARD to be profound that it becomes a parody of itself. 'Pull the sheets right off the corner / Of the mattress that you stole / From your roommate back in Boulder' \u2013 oh wow, BOULDER! How deliciously specific! Except this detail adds absolutely nothing except letting us know your ex is a petty thief with poor credit and questionable furniture ethics. And that Rover she 'can't afford'? We get it, she's financially irresponsible. You've mentioned broke down cars, stolen mattresses, and cars she can't afford so many times this song should come with a credit score warning. This isn't romance, it's a repo man's wet dream.\n\nBut the crown jewel of lyrical laziness? 'We ain't ever getting older' repeated FOURTEEN TIMES. FOURTEEN. That's not a chorus, that's a mantra for people in denial about their student loans. You know what else ain't ever getting older? These lyrics' emotional maturity, which peaked at roughly 'high school parking lot philosophy.' The whole 'bite that tattoo on your shoulder' line is trying so desperately to be sexy that it sounds like someone who learned about intimacy from a Cosmopolitan magazine quiz. 'Stay, and play that Blink-182 song / That we beat to death in Tucson' \u2013 at least Blink-182 had the decency to write creative lyrics before you beat them to death, unlike this song which arrived pre-deceased.\n\nThe narrative structure here is more scattered than their ex's financial planning. Four years, no calls, but suddenly you're reminiscing about mattress theft and bad Blink-182 cover sessions? 'I forget just why I left you, I was insane' \u2013 no bestie, you're STILL insane if you think any of this constitutes a compelling reason to reunite. This reads less like rekindling romance and more like two people who peaked emotionally in 2012 and are desperately trying to convince themselves that nostalgia equals compatibility. The hotel bar, the backseat hookup, the stolen furniture \u2013 this isn't a love story, it's a police blotter waiting to happen.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Self-destructive narrator who drinks too much", "quip": "Wow, an emotionally unavailable person with substance issues?

The stolen mattress from Boulder represents the theft of the American Dream, while the Rover she can't afford symbolizes the crushing weight of keeping up appearances in an Instagram economy.
