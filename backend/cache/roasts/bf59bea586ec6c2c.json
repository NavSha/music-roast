{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "Like a grocery store bouquet: functional, pleasant enough, but you know it's basically the same thing everyone else bought.", "the_roast": "Miley discovered the revolutionary concept that you can... buy things for yourself? Alert the Nobel Committee! 'I can buy myself flowers' is giving major 'I can tie my own shoes' energy. We're really setting the bar for independence at 'basic consumer behavior,' huh? Next single: 'I Can Use My Own Netflix Password (Better Than You Can).' The whole chorus is essentially a breakup anthem for people who just discovered self-care Sunday existed.\n\nThe bridge delivers the earth-shattering revelation 'I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna fight / Started to cry, but then remembered I' \u2014 and then just STOPS. Remembered you WHAT, Miley? Remembered you can breathe on your own? Remembered where you parked? This is the lyrical equivalent of leaving someone on read. The dramatic pause is doing more heavy lifting than a CrossFit instructor.\n\n'Talk to myself for hours / Say things you don't understand' is accidentally the most relatable line here, because honestly, same. Although if we're talking to ourselves for HOURS saying incomprehensible things, maybe we need to buy ourselves a therapist instead of flowers. And 'I can hold my own hand'? That's just called clasping your hands together, bestie. We've rebranded basic hand-holding coordination as peak self-love, and honestly, the confidence is admirable.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Built a home and watched it burn", "quip": "The real estate market is rough, but this seems like an insurance fraud situation"}, {"cliche": "We were gold", "quip": "No you weren't, you were a relationship with a Costco membership"}, {"cliche": "No remorse, no regret", "quip": "Definitely regret that you matched your nail polish to his apology roses though"}, {"cliche": "Write my name in the sand", "quip": "Very permanent statement about independence, until the tide comes in five minutes later"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Paint my nails cherry red / Match the roses that you left", "crime": "Coordinating your manicure to your ex's guilt flowers", "sentence": "Mandatory 6 months of mismatched socks to learn that moving on doesn't require color coordination"}, {"line": "Kind of dream that can't be sold", "crime": "Making relationships sound like an MLM pitch", "sentence": "Must attend three seminars on how healthy relationships aren't business transactions"}, {"line": "I can hold my own hand", "crime": "Rebranding 'praying' or 'having functional arms' as radical self-love", "sentence": "One year of practicing actual self-care that doesn't involve just... touching your own body parts"}, {"line": "Talk to myself for hours / Say things you don't understand", "crime": "Accidentally describing a mental health crisis as empowerment", "sentence": "Court-ordered clarification that this is either quirky or concerning, no in-between"}], "hidden_meanings": "This song is clearly a subtle commentary on late-stage capitalism, where self-worth can only be achieved through purchasing power and consumer autonomy.
