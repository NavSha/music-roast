{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "Three points for honesty, zero points for originality, minus several thousand for making 'If I Can't Have You' by Yvonne Elliman sound like a Harvard thesis.", "the_roast": "Oh look, someone discovered the 'psycho ex-girlfriend' aesthetic and decided to make it their entire personality in three minutes and forty-nine seconds. 'I'm so mature, I'm so mature, I'm so mature' \u2013 honey, if you have to say it THREE TIMES in a row, you're about as mature as a Chuck E. Cheese birthday party where someone spiked the juice boxes with pure delusion. That therapist you mention? They're moonlighting as a defense attorney now, because THIS TEXT GON' BE EVIDENCE.\n\nLet's talk about 'You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach' \u2013 because nothing screams 'unhinged' quite like stalking someone through organic produce while planning a felony. Did you really rhyme 'peach' with 'reach' and 'beat' and think we wouldn't notice you're just describing a very expensive trip to Whole Foods that ended in premeditated murder? And then 'Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion / Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat' \u2013 this is literally a confession set to a melody. Dateline NBC producers are taking notes.\n\nBut my absolute FAVORITE part is 'Rather be in jail than alone' becoming 'Rather be in Hell than alone' \u2013 because apparently the afterlife has better dating prospects than Hinge. You really said 'I did it all on no drugs, I did all of this sober' like that makes it BETTER? Ma'am, that's not the flex you think it is. That's literally the prosecution's opening statement. 'Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, she admits she was stone-cold sober when she committed double homicide because he bought fruit without her.' The only crime worse than the murders in this song is the crime of thinking toxic obsession counts as a personality trait.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "The 'If I can't have you, no one will' possessive lover trope", "quip": "Every Lifetime movie villain called \u2013 they want their only character trait back"}, {"cliche": "Mentioning therapy while clearly not listening to the therapist", "quip": "That's not how therapy works, that's how getting a second opinion from your delusions works"}, {"cliche": "The 'I still love him though' justification for unhinged behavior", "quip": "Love languages include: words of affirmation, acts of service, and apparently first-degree murder"}, {"cliche": "Claiming maturity while describing the opposite", "quip": "Saying you're mature three times doesn't make it true \u2013 it's like Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy by yelling it"}, {"cliche": "Rather be [terrible thing] than alone", "quip": "Girl, have you tried a hobby?
