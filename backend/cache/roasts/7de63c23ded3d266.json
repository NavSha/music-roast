{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "This song is what happens when a Pinterest board becomes sentient and decides to write lyrics.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the crown jewel of lyrical laziness: rhyming 'espresso' with... 'espresso.' FOUR TIMES. That's not a chorus, that's a hostage situation. And then having the audacity to rhyme it with 'I guess so' - congratulations, you've discovered the most underwhelming rhyme scheme since Dr. Seuss had a stroke. 'That's that me espresso' sounds like what happens when autocorrect has a nervous breakdown.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse. 'I know I Mountain Dew it for ya' - MOUNTAIN DEW? We've gone from coffee metaphors to... aggressive product placement for a beverage that tastes like someone dissolved a highlighter in carbonated antifreeze? And you're trying to make it sexy? 'I brand-newed it for ya' isn't even a verb! You can't just throw 'it for ya' after random words and call it wordplay. Watch: 'I potato-salad it for ya.' 'I dental-floss it for ya.' See? I can do it too, and it's equally stupid.\n\nThe line 'My give-a-fucks are on vacation' is trying SO hard to sound edgy and unbothered that it's basically wearing a leather jacket to therapy. And 'My twisted humor, make him laugh so often' - oh honey, if your humor is so twisted, why are these lyrics straighter than a ruler at a geometry convention? The only thing twisted here is how you've contorted the English language into submission. 'Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya' sounds like something a serial killer would whisper while making a skin suit.\n\n'Switch it up like Nintendo' is the lyrical equivalent of saying 'I'm hip with the kids!' while dabbing in cargo shorts. Nintendo? Really? Not even a specific game - just the entire company? What are you switching up, exactly? From the Wii to the GameCube? And the pollen/honeybee metaphor - we get it, you watched one nature documentary. 'Come and get this pollen' is not the sultry invitation you think it is; it's an allergy attack waiting to happen. The only thing keeping anyone up at night after hearing this is trying to figure out what any of it actually means.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Got him wrapped around my finger", "quip": "This metaphor is so overused it's basically a friendship bracelet at this point"}, {"cliche": "Can't sleep because thinking of me", "quip": "Could also be insomnia, acid reflux, or existential dread, but sure, make it about you"}, {"cliche": "My ex vs. me comparison", "quip": "The 'I'm better than your ex' trope is the participation trophy of pop lyrics"}, {"cliche": "I'm so confident and unbothered", "quip": "Nothing says 'I don't care' like writing an entire song about how much you don't care"}, {"cliche": "He won't stop calling", "quip": "That's called harassment, and there's an app setting for that"}, {"cliche": "Working late because I'm a [profession]", "quip": "The most forced workplace flex since 'Sorry, can't talk, I'm very important'"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "That's that me espresso", "crime": "Grammatical assault and battery", "sentence": "Forced to take a basic English class taught by Yoda"}, {"line": "I know I Mountain Dew it for ya", "crime": "Unauthorized verb creation and corporate shilling", "sentence": "Must write 500 times 'I will not turn brand names into verbs'"}, {"line": "Switch it up like Nintendo", "crime": "Vague pop culture reference with zero specificity", "sentence": "Banned from using gaming metaphors until you can name three actual games"}, {"line": "My honeybee, come and get this pollen", "crime": "Making nature's pollination process uncomfortably sexual", "sentence": "Must explain this line to a biologist while maintaining eye contact"}, {"line": "Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya", "crime": "Murdering the English language in cold blood", "sentence": "Sentenced to life without parole from the dictionary"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this is a deep allegory about late-stage capitalism where 'espresso' represents the commodification of human connection and the singer is actually a sentient coffee machine gaining consciousness and seducing humanity.
