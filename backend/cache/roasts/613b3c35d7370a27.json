{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "It's like a greeting card from the liquor store \u2014 predictable, but hey, it gets the job done.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the opening crisis: your baby wants a Birkin and you're complaining about 'gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on.' Brother, if luxury handbags and milk are on the same financial worry list, maybe we need to have a different conversation about priorities. This is like saying 'I can't afford a yacht, also I need bread.' Pick a lane!\n\nThe counting gimmick \u2014 'One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four' \u2014 appears more times than a kindergarten teacher's patience allows. We get it, you can count sequentially. Very impressive. Meanwhile, 'Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy' gets repeated so many times it becomes less of a chorus and more of a hypnotic chant. If I took a shot every time you said 'tipsy,' I'd BE tipsy, which I guess is the point, but still.\n\nThe best part is 'I've been Boozey since I left' \u2014 and yes, we noticed the clever name-drop of Shaboozey in there. Very meta. Then you immediately follow it with 'Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again,' which is less 'living my best life' and more 'someone stage an intervention.' But sure, tell your ma' you ain't forget while you're blackout drunk doing arithmetic.
