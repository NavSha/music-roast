{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "This song is what happens when a country singer discovers rhymezone.com and a 2004 rap counting song had a baby in a dive bar.", "the_roast": "Let's start with that opening verse, shall we? 'My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long / Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on.' Congratulations, you've somehow made financial anxiety sound less interesting than reading a CVS receipt. The emotional depth here is shallower than the whiskey in that double shot you keep begging for. You're complaining about your 9 to 5 not working, but buddy, these lyrics aren't exactly punching the clock either.\n\nThen we get to the chorus, where Shaboozey discovers he has 'a history' with Jack Daniel's. Oh wow, a drinking song about Jack Daniel's? How incredibly brave and original! No one in the entire history of country music has ever thought to mention that particular brand before. The specificity is STUNNING. And telling us there's a party 'downtown, near 5th Street'? Thank you for that crystal-clear GPS coordinate. Is it near the Applebee's or the other Applebee's?\n\nThe counting sequence 'One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four' appears THREE TIMES in this song, like Shaboozey just learned numbers and wants to show off his kindergarten education. It's giving 'Cupid Shuffle' meets 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' at a wedding reception nobody wanted to attend. And 'Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor'\u2014yeah, that's called public intoxication and property damage, my guy. But sure, make it sound romantic.\n\nThe bridge about being 'Boozey since I left' is either a cry for help or a really lazy way to work your stage name into the song. 'I ain't changin' for a check' he says, IN A SONG THAT CLEARLY GOT HIM A CHECK. The irony is thicker than the hangover you're definitely nursing. And that final spoken line 'That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar'\u2014yes, we know. You told us EIGHT TIMES that everyone was getting tipsy. They probably kicked you out for repeating yourself like a malfunctioning jukebox.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Girlfriend wants expensive things", "quip": "The Birkin bag reference: because nothing says 'authentic country struggle' like luxury handbags that cost more than a used truck"}, {"cliche": "9 to 5 ain't working", "quip": "Complaining about your day job in a song that's literally your job\u2014the ouroboros of corporate rebellion"}, {"cliche": "Me and [alcohol brand] got history", "quip": "Having a 'history' with Jack Daniel's isn't a personality trait, it's a warning label"}, {"cliche": "Counting to four before the drop", "quip": "Using the 1-2-3-4 count THREE separate times\u2014we get it, you can count, here's your gold star"}, {"cliche": "Party downtown/specific street", "quip": "Near 5th Street!
