{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "Three points because at least it rhymes better than a drunk opera singer's suicide note written during a thunderstorm.", "the_roast": "Let me get this straight: Freddie opens with four consecutive questions like he's having an existential crisis at a philosophy 101 lecture, then immediately declares himself a 'poor boy' who needs no sympathy WHILE BEGGING FOR SYMPATHY FOR THE ENTIRE SONG. Pick a lane, mate. You can't be 'easy come, easy go' and then spend six minutes having a complete meltdown because 'Mama, ooo.' This isn't emotional depth, it's emotional whiplash set to a piano.\n\nThe murder confession section reads like a teenager's creative writing assignment where they discovered the thesaurus but not narrative coherence. 'Mama, just killed a man / Put a gun against his head / Pulled my trigger, now he's dead' \u2013 congratulations, you've managed to make homicide sound as exciting as reading assembly instructions. And the kicker? 'Life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away' \u2013 yeah, that tends to happen when you MURDER SOMEONE. Real shocking development there, Sherlock.\n\nThen we barrel headfirst into what I can only describe as a fever dream written by someone who fell asleep during both an opera AND a Renaissance fair. 'Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango'? Excuse me? We went from murder confession to randomly summoning commedia dell'arte characters and demanding they perform Spanish dances. And screaming 'Galileo' five times doesn't make you cultured, it makes you sound like you're having a stroke at a planetarium. Throw in some 'Bismillah' (because nothing says authentic Arabic prayer like using it to beg imaginary court figures to let you go), a random 'Beelzebub' name-drop, and a 'mama mia' because apparently we're doing ALL the languages now, and you've got yourself a linguistic trash fire.\n\nThe grand finale? After all this operatic chaos, murder mystery, and religious confusion, we end with 'Nothing really matters' repeated like a depressed fortune cookie. Oh, NOW nothing matters? You just spent five minutes acting like EVERYTHING matters \u2013 your mama, your trial, your soul, Galileo's opinion \u2013 but sure, let's just wrap it up with nihilism and call it deep.
