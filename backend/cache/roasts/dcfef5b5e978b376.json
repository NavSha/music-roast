{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "This song has all the lyrical depth of a motivational poster written by a malfunctioning printer.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the self-own heard 'round the world: 'I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain.' Wow, Taylor really came out swinging at herself harder than any hater ever could. That's not vulnerability, that's just handing your critics the ammunition AND loading the gun for them. The whole first verse reads like she's workshopping insults about herself in the mirror.\n\nBut the real crime here is the chorus, which apparently believes that repeating a word five times makes it profound. 'Players gonna play, play, play, play, play' \u2014 congratulations, you've discovered that people do the things they do! What's next, 'Walkers gonna walk' and 'Talkers gonna talk'? This is the lyrical equivalent of that kid in class who had to reach a word count so they just typed 'very very very very interesting.' Except this was intentional and someone got paid millions for it. The song has said 'shake' so many times it should come with a warning label for people with motion sickness.\n\nThe bridge tries to get edgy with 'this sick beat' and 'hella good hair,' which feels like a youth pastor trying to connect with the teens. 'My ex-man bought his new girlfriend' is either missing crucial words or Taylor's ex purchased a human being, which raises different concerns entirely. And the solution to all life's problems? Shaking. Broke up? Shake it off. Lost your job? Shake it off. Existential crisis? Just shake it off! It's self-help advice from a Magic 8-Ball that only has one answer.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Haters gonna hate", "quip": "So overused it should be in the Clich\u00e9 Hall of Fame next to 'it is what it is'"}, {"cliche": "Dancing like no one's watching", "quip": "Except she literally says people ARE watching and judging, so the math isn't mathing"}, {"cliche": "Make the moves up as I go", "quip": "The lyrical version of 'live, laugh, love' \u2014 meaningless but sounds vaguely inspirational"}, {"cliche": "Lightning on my feet", "quip": "A metaphor so tired it needs a nap and some Red Bull"}, {"cliche": "Can't stop, won't stop", "quip": "The mantra of both motivational speakers and people who refuse to stop talking at parties"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Got nothing in my brain", "crime": "Self-deprecation so extreme it becomes accidentally accurate", "sentence": "Must write 500 words on why self-roasting requires subtlety"}, {"line": "Players gonna play, play, play, play, play", "crime": "Repetition as a substitute for actual content", "sentence": "Copy and paste this comment five, five, five, five, five times"}, {"line": "I shake it off, I shake it off (\u00d747)", "crime": "Using 'shake it off' more times than a Polaroid instruction manual", "sentence": "Mandatory attendance at a thesaurus workshop"}, {"line": "Fella over there with the hella good hair", "crime": "Forced rhyming that sounds like it was written by a mall kiosk poet", "sentence": "Banned from using 'hella' until it comes back in style (never)"}, {"line": "My ex-man bought his new girlfriend", "crime": "Either missing words or describing human trafficking", "sentence": "Grammar lessons and a police investigation"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this is a deep meditation on Sisyphean philosophy \u2014 endlessly shaking off problems only to have new ones appear, trapped in an eternal cycle of shimmy-based denial.

It's catchy enough to get stuck in your head, but so are commercial jingles, and at least those have the decency to be thirty seconds long.", "artist": "Taylor Swift", "title": "Shake It Off", "severity": "medium"}
