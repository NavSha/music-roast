{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "Like therapy session meets rhyming dictionary meets a Pinterest board about self-awareness.", "the_roast": "Let's start with 'I get older but just never wiser' \u2014 congratulations on discovering what literally everyone experiences after their third existential crisis and second bottle of wine. This isn't profound, Taylor, it's called being in your thirties. And 'when my depression works the graveyard shift'? Ma'am, depression doesn't clock in and out like it's got a union card. It's not filing for overtime benefits.\n\nThe chorus 'It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me / At tea time, everybody agrees' is doing so much heavy lifting it should qualify for workers' comp. You're really telling us that your friend group gathered for TEA TIME \u2014 not brunch, not drinks, but actual Victorian tea time \u2014 to formally vote on whether you're problematic? Did you use Robert's Rules of Order? Was there a motion to table? 'I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror' is actually a solid line, I'll give you that, but then you immediately follow it with 'must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero' like you're narrating your own biopic. Self-awareness is great, but you've basically written the musical equivalent of live-tweeting your own therapy session.\n\n'Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby / And I'm a monster on the hill' \u2014 I'm sorry, a SEXY BABY? Are we just mashing random words together now? And lurching toward favorite cities like King Kong in a romper? The 'covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism / Like some kind of congressman' line is chef's kiss for political shade, but then you ruin it by rhyming 'screaming' with 'dreaming' and 'meaning' so many times I thought my streaming service was stuck on repeat.\n\nAnd that bridge? That BRIDGE? You're having fever dreams about your daughter-in-law murdering you for inheritance money and laughing from hell? Either your estate planning attorney needs a raise or you need to lay off the true crime documentaries before bed. This isn't dark humor, it's a plot rejected from Knives Out for being too on-the-nose.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Depression personified as something with work hours", "quip": "Depression doesn't punch a time card, sweetie, it's salaried with unlimited PTO"}, {"cliche": "Staring at the sun vs. mirror metaphor", "quip": "The sun vs. mirror thing called from 2012 Tumblr \u2014 it wants its deep quote back"}, {"cliche": "Self-sabotage as a personality trait", "quip": "Making bad decisions isn't a quirk, it's just called making bad decisions"}, {"cliche": "The 'I'm a monster' self-deprecation", "quip": "Calling yourself a monster when you're really just mildly annoying is stolen valor from actual villains"}, {"cliche": "Scheming as relationship conflict", "quip": "Unless you're literally a cartoon villain with a handlebar mustache, maybe just communicate"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Midnights become my afternoons", "crime": "Confusing insomnia with having a quirky sleep schedule", "sentence": "Mandatory enrollment in a circadian rhythm boot camp"}, {"line": "They come with prices and vices / I end up in crisis", "crime": "Rhyming words that are 90% the same syllables", "sentence": "Sentenced to read a thesaurus cover to cover"}, {"line": "Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby", "crime": "Creating a phrase that sounds like a rejected SNL sketch title", "sentence": "Required to explain what a sexy baby is to a room full of confused grandparents"}, {"line": "Did you hear my covert narcissism lightly disguised as altruism", "crime": "Announcing your covert narcissism thereby making it extremely overt", "sentence": "Ten hours of Philosophy 101 lectures on the definition of 'covert'"}, {"line": "She's laughing up at us from hell", "crime": "Admitting you'd be a villain from beyond the grave", "sentence": "Eternal haunting by the ghost of healthy family dynamics"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this is an elaborate allegory about how being famous is like being Godzilla at a Build-A-Bear workshop \u2014 too big for the space, accidentally destructive, and everyone's filming you.
