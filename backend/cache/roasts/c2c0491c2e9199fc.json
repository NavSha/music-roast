{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "A solid 4 out of 10 \u2014 because apparently 'codependency chic' is the new black, and therapy is so last season.", "the_roast": "Oh good, another ballad where dying alone is presented as romance's ultimate failure state. 'Til I'm in the grave, 'til I rot away, dead and buried' \u2014 girl, this isn't a love song, it's a hostage negotiation with a casket. You've essentially written a prenup for the afterlife, and spoiler alert: even death is trying to file a restraining order.\n\nLet's talk about 'If you go, I'm goin' too' \u2014 congratulations, you've turned Romeo and Juliet into a threat. This isn't devotion, this is the emotional equivalent of 'if I can't have you, nobody can,' except you're doing it to yourself. And 'if I'm turning blue, please don't save me'? That's not romantic, that's a liability waiver. I can see the paramedics now: 'Ma'am, we need to perform CPR\u2014' 'No, no, she left very specific instructions in song form.'\n\nThe 'birds of a feather' metaphor is doing some HEAVY lifting here, trying to make 'I have zero sense of self without you' sound poetic. Real birds of a feather actually separate sometimes \u2014 it's called migration, honey. They don't cling to each other screaming 'WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER' while plummeting to earth. And that line 'I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone' is so grammatically pretzel'd, I need a linguistics degree and a chiropractor to unpack it. Triple negatives aren't deep, they're just confusing.\n\n'You're so full of shit, tell me it's a bit' \u2014 FINALLY, some self-awareness breaks through the fog of codependency! But then immediately after this brief moment of clarity, we're back to 'don't wanna say goodbye' and death pacts. It's like watching someone almost escape a cult, then voluntarily walking back in because the Kool-Aid slaps. And that past life stuff at the end? Oh perfect, because one lifetime of this exhausting attachment style wasn't enough \u2014 you had to make it ETERNAL. Soulmate theory is just astrology for people who are bad at breaking up.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "'Til the day that I die' (repeated 47 times, or it felt like it)", "quip": "Yes, we get it.
