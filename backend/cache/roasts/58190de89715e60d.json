{"overall_score": 3, "overall_score_comment": "The literary equivalent of a participation trophy at a poetry slam in a truck stop bathroom.", "the_roast": "Let's start with 'South Detroit' \u2014 a place that DOESN'T EXIST unless you count Windsor, Canada, which means our city boy was 'born and raised' in a geographic hallucination. Steve Perry out here writing fan fiction about imaginary neighborhoods like he's J.R.R. Tolkien but for people who peaked in high school. The whole song is basically two broke people meeting on public transportation with zero plan, zero destination, just vibes and reckless financial irresponsibility. 'Goin' anywhere' isn't romantic, it's called being homeless with a train pass.\n\nThen we get the Pulitzer-worthy couplet 'A singer in a smokey room / A smell of wine and cheap perfume' \u2014 yes, that's called a dive bar at 2 AM, not a Meet Cute. These two are about to 'share the night' based on a smile, which is apparently all the vetting process you need when your standards are lower than the floor of that smokey room. 'For a smile they can share the night' has the same energy as 'for a Klondike bar, what would you do?' except sadder and with more questionable decisions.\n\n'Streetlights, people' might be the laziest lyrical pairing since someone rhymed 'fire' with 'desire.' It's not even a complete thought! It's like Perry forgot the rest of the sentence mid-karaoke and just decided to make it the chorus. And we're supposed to believe these random nouns constitute profound wisdom? 'Living just to find emotion, hiding somewhere in the night' \u2014 my brother in Christ, that's called having depression and poor coping mechanisms, not a philosophy. The whole song is basically an aesthetic mood board for people who think waiting for a bus is deep.\n\nThe gambling metaphor comes in with 'Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time' like we're supposed to find profundity in people with obvious addiction issues. 'Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues' \u2014 congratulations, you've discovered that life has outcomes. That's not wisdom, that's a fortune cookie written by someone going through an existential crisis at a craps table. And 'the movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on' \u2014 yeah, that's the problem with this song too, buddy. We get it. Things continue. You can stop now.\n\nAnd finally, FINALLY, we get to the titular advice: 'Don't stop believin' \u2014 in WHAT?! You never told us! Believing in finding South Detroit on a map? Believing that meeting strangers on trains based solely on their smile is a solid life strategy? The song is basically telling us to have hope without ever specifying hope FOR WHAT. It's the motivational poster equivalent of 'Live, Laugh, Love' except it costs $15 for a beer every time someone plays it at a wedding.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Small town girl meets city boy", "quip": "Wow, what a fresh take!
