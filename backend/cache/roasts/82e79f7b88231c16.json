{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "Like Houdini himself, the lyrical depth has completely vanished.", "the_roast": "Dua Lipa really said 'what if I named a song after one of history's greatest escape artists and then just... repeated the same four lines until everyone desperately wanted to escape?' The entire song is basically 'I come and I go' sung seventeen different ways, like she's stuck in a revolving door and decided to make it her whole personality. 'Catch me or I go Houdini' \u2014 girl, Houdini was famous for PLANNED escapes from handcuffs and water tanks, not just being flaky at parties. This is less magic trick, more ghosting someone on a dating app.\n\nThe bridge attempts depth with 'Time is passin' like a solar eclipse' which sounds profound until you realize solar eclipses last like two minutes, so yeah, accurate metaphor for this song's substance. Then we get 'do you practice everything that you preach?' which is rich coming from someone whose entire lyrical sermon is 'maybe convince me to stay... but also I'm leaving... but maybe I'm not... actually I'm definitely leaving... unless?' Pick a lane, Dua! This is the musical equivalent of those people who announce they're leaving the party five times but are still there two hours later.\n\nThe real crime is 'Prove you got the right to please me' repeated ad nauseam like it's some kind of empowerment anthem, when really it just sounds like she's conducting boyfriend auditions with the charisma of a DMV clerk. And 'Maybe you could cause a girl to change her ways' \u2014 so the whole 'I come and I go' thing is just a personality trait she's WAITING for someone to fix? That's not mysterious, that's just commitment issues with a disco beat.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "I come and I go (x47)", "quip": "We get it, you're emotionally unavailable.
