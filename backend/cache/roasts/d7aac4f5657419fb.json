{"overall_score": 2, "overall_score_comment": "This song has the lyrical depth of a puddle in a dive bar parking lot at 3 AM.", "the_roast": "Let me get this straight: your girl wants a Birkin, you're complaining about gas and groceries, questioning why you work so hard at your 9-to-5, but your solution is to... drink whiskey and forget about it? Congratulations, you've written the financial planning anthem for people who wonder why their credit score looks like a bowling score. This is literally 'I can't afford my life so I'll spend what little money I have at a bar' set to music. The economic illiteracy is STUNNING.\n\nThe counting 'one, here comes the two, to the three, to the four' appears THREE TIMES in this song. Brother, we learned to count in kindergarten. We don't need a refresher course every forty-five seconds. This isn't Sesame Street: After Dark Edition. And 'two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor'? That's not impressive choreography, that's property damage and a health code violation. Your dance moves are literally why bars have to post 'Please don't stand on the furniture' signs.\n\nThe entire relationship with Jack Daniel's being described as 'history' is doing a LOT of heavy lifting here. That's not a history, that's a dependency with a marketing jingle. 'Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again' isn't a flex, it's a cry for help that rhymes. And the fact that you're telling your ma' you 'ain't forget' while you're blackout drunk is peak comedy. Ma' KNOWS you forgot, Shaboozey. She's seen your liver function tests.\n\nBut the CROWN JEWEL of this trainwreck is 'At the bottom of a bottle gon' miss me.' WHO is going to miss you? The bartender who's tired of cutting you off? Your liver? Your financial advisor who quit? The song never tells us, because even the lyrics know nobody's actually missing someone who spends their rent money on double shots while their partner's asking for designer bags they definitely can't afford. The spoken outro 'That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar' is the only honest moment in the entire song\u2014yes, it IS messed up, because you've been standing on tables for three verses straight.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Counting to four like it's profound", "quip": "Sir, this is a song, not a sobriety test you're failing"}, {"cliche": "Me and [alcohol brand] got history", "quip": "That's not history, that's a sponsorship deal your liver didn't approve"}, {"cliche": "Drowning problems at the bar", "quip": "Spoiler alert: The problems learned to swim and they're waiting at home"}, {"cliche": "Woke up drunk, gonna do it again", "quip": "The anthem of every intervention waiting to happen"}, {"cliche": "Everybody gettin' tipsy", "quip": "Repeated 847 times in case we forgot what bars are for"}, {"cliche": "Tell your girl to bring a friend", "quip": "Bold strategy for someone who can't even afford groceries"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "My baby want a Birkin, she's been tellin' me all night long / Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on", "crime": "Financial negligence in the first degree", "sentence": "Mandatory Dave Ramsey class and a budgeting app that sends your bank balance to your mom"}, {"line": "I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone", "crime": "Promoting avoidance as a lifestyle philosophy", "sentence": "Forced to listen to self-help podcasts while sober until you develop one coping mechanism"}, {"line": "Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again", "crime": "Bragging about alcoholism like it's a personality trait", "sentence": "Coffee and water only for six months, plus AA meetings disguised as songwriting workshops"}, {"line": "At the bottom of a bottle gon' miss me", "crime": "Creating grammatically confusing statements about emotional availability while intoxicated", "sentence": "English class and therapy, in that order, both mandatory"}, {"line": "One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four", "crime": "Repetitive lyrical laziness masquerading as a hook", "sentence": "Must write 100 original count-based lyrics that aren't just numbers in sequence, no bathroom breaks"}], "hidden_meanings": "This is clearly a sophisticated metaphor about late-stage capitalism, where the working class drowns their economic anxiety in consumable goods (whiskey) while their partners demand luxury items (Birkin bags) they cannot afford, creating a cycle of escapism and financial ruin.
