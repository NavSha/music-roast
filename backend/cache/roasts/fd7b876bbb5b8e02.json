{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "Like a fortune cookie written by someone who forgot what they wanted to say halfway through.", "the_roast": "Kurt Cobain really woke up one day and said 'You know what this generation needs? A song where I say hello twelve times and then compare myself to a mosquito.' And somehow it worked! The opening line 'Load up on guns, bring your friends' sounds like the world's most concerning birthday party invitation, followed immediately by 'It's fun to lose and to pretend' \u2014 which is basically just describing every participation trophy ceremony ever.\n\nThe chorus is essentially Kurt playing phone tag with the abyss, asking 'how low?' nine times like he's checking the limbo bar at the apocalypse. Then we get the iconic 'Here we are now, entertain us' \u2014 the most Gen X thing ever written, like showing up to a party, sitting in the corner, and demanding everyone impress you while you judge them. And 'I feel stupid and contagious'? My guy, that's just called having the flu. See a doctor.\n\nBut let's talk about the lyrical fever dream that is 'A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido.' This reads like Kurt was playing Mad Libs during a biology class he was failing. It's four random nouns that rhyme-ish, thrown together with the energy of someone who just remembered the song was due tomorrow. And then he just goes 'Yeah, hey, yay' like that somehow ties it all together. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.\n\nThe bridge delivers the profound wisdom of 'I forget just why I taste / Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile' \u2014 which is either about food, kissing, or he's licking random objects. All equally plausible. Then he wraps it up with 'Oh well, whatever, never mind,' which is the lyrical equivalent of saying 'I don't know, you figure it out.' The song ends with him shouting 'A denial!' nine times, which honestly feels like what he'd say if you asked him if these lyrics made any sense.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Saying hello repeatedly instead of actual words", "quip": "When you've got nothing to say but you're committed to the bit"}, {"cliche": "Oh well, whatever, never mind", "quip": "The official motto of giving up on your own thoughts"}, {"cliche": "Asking the audience to entertain you", "quip": "Peak grunge entitlement: show up, demand fun, provide riddles"}, {"cliche": "Ending with repetitive shouting", "quip": "Because nine denials are exactly eight more convincing than one"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "She's over bored and self assured", "crime": "Inventing 'over bored' instead of 'overbored' or just using actual words", "sentence": "Sentenced to one semester of remedial English"}, {"line": "A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido", "crime": "Playing musical Mad Libs and calling it poetry", "sentence": "Must explain this comparison to a panel of confused biologists"}, {"line": "I'm worse at what I do best", "crime": "Creating a paradox that even philosophers would skip", "sentence": "Condemned to an eternity of circular logic puzzles"}, {"line": "And I forget just why I taste", "crime": "Leaving everyone wondering what you're licking and why", "sentence": "Mandatory attendance at a workshop on completing your thoughts"}, {"line": "Hello, hello, hello, how low?", "crime": "Asking the same question twelve times like we're all hard of hearing", "sentence": "Required to communicate using only complete sentences for one month"}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly this song is a metaphor for the existential crisis of being a sentient mosquito trying to understand its place in a world of albinoism and confused libidos. The repeated hellos represent humanity's desperate attempt to connect in an increasingly disconnected world, or maybe Kurt just really liked the way it sounded. The 'dirty word' he knows is probably 'coherence.'", "final_verdict": "This song is what happens when you write lyrics on a napkin during a fever dream and then accidentally become the voice of a generation. It makes zero sense, and somehow that's exactly the point \u2014 which is either genius or the greatest accidental prank in music history.", "artist": "Nirvana", "title": "Smells Like Teen Spirit", "severity": "mild"}
