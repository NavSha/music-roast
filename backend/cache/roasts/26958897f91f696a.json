{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "It's like a fortune cookie wrote a diss track\u2014sounds profound until you realize you've read it three times already.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the elephant in the room: Doja opens with Dionne Warwick's 'Walk on by' like she's sampling your grandma's vinyl collection, then immediately hits us with 'Yeah, bitch, I said what I said.' It's the musical equivalent of wearing a ball gown to a house party\u2014technically impressive, but girl, read the room! And speaking of reading, can we talk about how she says this exact phrase approximately 847 times? 'I said what I said' becomes less of a power move and more of a reminder app notification you forgot to turn off.\n\nThe middle section is where things get wonderfully chaotic. 'I put good dick all in my kidneys' is certainly... a choice of anatomy lesson that would make your health teacher faint. And then we pivot to 'This Margiel' don't come with no jealousy' faster than you can Google how to spell Margiela correctly. It's like she's playing Mad Libs with a medical textbook and a fashion magazine. The line 'My illness don't come with no remedy' hits different when you realize the illness might be chronic repetition syndrome.\n\nBy the time we get to 'She the devil, she a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel,' repeated more times than a toddler asking for candy, you start to wonder if the settle/pedal/devil/rebel rhyme scheme is holding the song hostage. And bless her heart for rhyming 'I'd win' with 'sidekick' and 'like it'\u2014that's not so much a rhyme as it is three words standing near each other at a party pretending to know each other. The song ends with Dionne Warwick essentially telling us to walk away, and honestly?
