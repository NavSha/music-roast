{"overall_score": 4, "overall_score_comment": "It's like Kurt wrote this on a napkin during a game of Mad Libs and thought, 'Yeah, that'll do.'", "the_roast": "Let's start with the obvious: 'Load up on guns, bring your friends / It's fun to lose and to pretend.' Kurt, my guy, this sounds like the world's most depressing birthday party invitation. And what's with 'She's over bored and self assured / Oh no, I know a dirty word'? Congratulations on discovering profanity, I guess? Most of us learned that skill around age seven, but sure, let's act shocked about it.\n\nThen we get to the chorus, which is just Kurt screaming 'Hello' twelve times like he's checking if his phone connection is working, followed by 'how low?' \u2014 which, ironically, is exactly what we're all asking about the lyrical standards here. 'Here we are now, entertain us' is the battle cry of every entitled teenager ever, and 'I feel stupid and contagious' is genuinely the most accurate self-assessment in rock history. But then \u2014 THEN \u2014 we get the crown jewel of random word association: 'A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido.' This reads like Kurt was playing Scrabble with a fever dream. What do these things have in common? Absolutely nothing, except they vaguely rhyme if you squint your ears hard enough.\n\nThe second verse is where it really falls apart: 'I'm worse at what I do best / And for this gift I feel blessed.' So you're bad at being good? That's not a flex, that's just underachieving with extra steps. And 'Our little group has always been / And always will until the end' is so grammatically incomplete it makes my English teacher weep. Has always been WHAT, Kurt? Don't leave us hanging! Oh wait, you did.\n\n'And I forget just why I taste / Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile' \u2014 excuse me, why you TASTE? Are you eating yourself? Is this some weird grunge cannibalism metaphor? And the follow-up 'I found it hard, it's hard to find / Oh well, whatever, never mind' is basically Kurt shrugging at his own lyrics mid-song. That's the energy of someone who forgot their homework and is just winging the presentation. Finally, the song ends with him screaming 'A DENIAL!' nine times, which is honestly the perfect summary: this whole song is in denial about being coherent.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "The 'entertain us' demand from a bored generation", "quip": "Every rebellious teenager's mantra since MTV was invented \u2014 groundbreaking stuff, really."}, {"cliche": "Saying 'hello' repeatedly as if repetition equals depth", "quip": "Is this a song or are you just really bad at phone etiquette?"}, {"cliche": "The self-deprecating 'I feel stupid' routine", "quip": "At least we can all agree on something for once."}, {"cliche": "Throwing in random words that rhyme-ish as 'symbolism'", "quip": "Mosquito, libido, potato \u2014 see, I can do it too!"}, {"cliche": "The classic 'oh well, whatever, never mind' apathy", "quip": "The official slogan of people who don't want to finish their thoughts."}, {"cliche": "'It's fun to lose' nihilism", "quip": "Spoken like someone who's never won anything and made it their whole personality."}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido", "crime": "Random word salad masquerading as poetry", "sentence": "Mandatory songwriting workshop where you learn that rhyming requires actual CONNECTION between ideas."}, {"line": "Hello, hello, hello, how low?", "crime": "Assault with repetitive greeting", "sentence": "Twelve consecutive hellos in public spaces \u2014 you're now banned from all phone conversations."}, {"line": "And I forget just why I taste", "crime": "Making absolutely zero sense while sounding profound", "sentence": "Sentenced to explain this line to a room full of confused English majors for eternity."}, {"line": "I'm worse at what I do best", "crime": "Paradoxical humblebragging that means nothing", "sentence": "Community service teaching logic classes because clearly you need them too."}, {"line": "Our little group has always been / And always will until the end", "crime": "Leaving a sentence dangling like a participle at a grammar rodeo", "sentence": "Forced to complete every sentence you start for the next year \u2014 no exceptions."}], "hidden_meanings": "Clearly, this song is a sophisticated commentary on the existential dread of being a mosquito with identity issues and a surprisingly active libido. The repeated denials at the end? That's Kurt denying he actually knows what this song is about. The 'how low' refrain is obviously him asking how low the bar for lyrics can go before someone stops him \u2014 spoiler alert: nobody did.", "final_verdict": "This is what happens when you write a song, forget what you wrote, then perform it anyway and somehow it becomes a generational anthem.
