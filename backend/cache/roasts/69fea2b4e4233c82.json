{"overall_score": 7, "overall_score_comment": "Like a participation trophy for vague optimism\u2014everybody gets one!", "the_roast": "Let's address the elephant on the midnight train: 'South Detroit' doesn't exist, Steve Perry. You're literally singing about a fictional place like it's the hometown on someone's dating profile. The whole song reads like someone's creative writing assignment where the prompt was 'be as nonspecific as humanly possible.' Small town girl meets city boy, both somehow taking the SAME midnight train going 'anywhere'\u2014that's not romantic, that's just poor travel planning and a concerning lack of destination awareness.\n\nThe imagery here is chef's kiss vague: 'A singer in a smokey room'\u2014what singer? Singing what? And 'the smell of wine and cheap perfume' sounds less like romance and more like someone's describing a Spirit Airlines flight at 2 AM. Then we get the profound observation that 'some will win, some will lose'\u2014wow, thanks Journey, that's really narrowed it down. What's next, 'some people are tall, some are short'? The depth is truly staggering.\n\nBut the real MVP here is 'streetlights, people'\u2014a two-word phrase so vague it could describe literally any city at any time. It's like playing lyrical Mad Libs but forgetting to fill in the actual details. And after all this scenic tour of Vagueville, the big inspirational payoff is just 'don't stop believin''\u2014believing in WHAT, exactly? The midnight train schedule? The existence of South Detroit? The hope that this song will eventually tell us what's actually happening?", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Small town girl/city boy romance", "quip": "Because apparently they couldn't afford the rights to 'uptown girl'"}, {"cliche": "Midnight train going anywhere", "quip": "That's not adventurous, that's just having no return ticket"}, {"cliche": "Rolling the dice", "quip": "The only gamble here is whether this metaphor will ever pay off"}, {"cliche": "Some will win, some will lose", "quip": "Yes, and some will write incredibly obvious lyrics"}, {"cliche": "Born to sing the blues", "quip": "While others were apparently born to sing about street infrastructure"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "Born and raised in South Detroit", "crime": "Geographic fraud", "sentence": "Mandatory map-reading classes and a public apology to Michigan"}, {"line": "Streetlights, people", "crime": "Giving up mid-sentence", "sentence": "Must complete all thoughts before leaving the recording studio"}, {"line": "The movie never ends, it goes on and on and on and on", "crime": "Describing my feelings about this repetitive chorus", "sentence": "Ironic self-awareness but still guilty"}, {"line": "Livin' just to find emotion, hidin' somewhere in the night", "crime": "Peak 80s vagueness", "sentence": "Community service explaining what this actually means"}], "hidden_meanings": "This is clearly an allegory about two people with terrible navigation skills who meet at a train station and bond over their shared inability to pick a destination.
