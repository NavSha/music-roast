{"overall_score": 7, "overall_score_comment": "Like a true crime podcast hosted by your most dramatic friend \u2014 equal parts entertaining and concerning.", "the_roast": "Look, I appreciate the self-awareness of chanting 'I'm so mature' while literally plotting a double homicide in your basement. That's like wearing a 'World's Best Driver' t-shirt while running a red light. The therapist is doing GREAT work here, really earning that copay when you respond to 'there's other men' with 'cool story, but I'm gonna need bail money.'\n\nThe farmer's market detail is chef's kiss levels of petty. Not 'he took her somewhere nice' \u2014 no, it's specifically the FARMER'S MARKET with a PERFECT PEACH. You're about to commit felonies and you're still mad about organic produce. That's the kind of specific jealousy that belongs in a group chat, not a murder plan. And can we talk about how you jumped from 'saw him shopping for fruit' to 'planning home invasion' with ZERO steps in between? That's not character development, that's a teleportation spell fueled by pure spite.\n\nThe real tragedy is the disclaimer 'I did it all on no drugs / I did all of this sober' \u2014 like you're worried people might think SUBSTANCES were the problem here. Ma'am, the call is coming from inside the house. You're out here writing confession letters set to a beat and calling them text messages that are 'evidence.' At least you're documenting your own crimes efficiently.

The 'basement' symbolizes descending into late-stage relationship entropy, and 'jail' is actually freedom from society's oppressive expectation that we be normal about breakups. Or maybe it's just about wanting to commit crimes.
