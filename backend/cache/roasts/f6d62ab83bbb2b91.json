{"overall_score": 6, "overall_score_comment": "It's like a fortune cookie wrote a diss track \u2014 sounds profound until you realize you've read the same thing twelve times.", "the_roast": "Let's start with the elephant in the room: Doja sampled Dionne Warwick's 'Walk On By' and then proceeded to walk ON by any semblance of lyrical variety. 'She the devil, she a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel' gets repeated so many times, I'm pretty sure it qualifies as a meditation mantra at this point. If I wanted this much repetition, I'd just hit my head against a wall while listening to a car alarm.\n\nThe anatomical geography lesson in 'I put good dick all in my kidneys' is sending medical students into crisis mode. Ma'am, that's not how kidneys work, and if it IS, you need a doctor, not a record deal. Meanwhile, 'My illness don't come with no remedy' followed immediately by 'I am so much fun without Hennessy' is giving us whiplash faster than a neck injury lawyer convention. Are we bragging about being sick or about sobriety? Pick a lane!\n\nThe self-awareness is simultaneously the song's best and worst quality. 'I'd rather be famous instead' and 'I let all that get to my head' \u2014 okay, we appreciate the honesty, but repeating it eight times doesn't make it deeper, it makes it a ringtone. And 'Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more' at the END of a song literally titled 'Paint the Town Red' about wanting to be famous is the kind of plot twist M. Night Shyamalan would reject for being too contradictory. It's like ordering a supersized Big Mac meal and then announcing you're not really hungry.\n\nThe whole 'devil/rebel/pedal/settle' rhyme scheme is working harder than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest, showing up in every single chorus like that one friend who doesn't know when the party's over. And 'You gon' see me eatin' ten more times' \u2014 is that a threat or a Mukbang channel announcement? I genuinely can't tell if we're being intimidated or invited to brunch.", "cliche_counter": [{"cliche": "Calling herself 'the devil' and a 'bad bitch'", "quip": "Edgy teenager core, except the teenager has a Vegas residency"}, {"cliche": "The 'I don't care' attitude repeated ad nauseam", "quip": "If you truly didn't care, you wouldn't need to tell us 47 times"}, {"cliche": "Foot to the pedal metaphor", "quip": "Every rapper since 2003 called, they want their gas pedal back"}, {"cliche": "Money and fame declarations", "quip": "Groundbreaking stuff \u2014 next you'll tell us you like expensive things"}, {"cliche": "The 'haters can't stop me' energy", "quip": "Nothing says 'I'm unbothered' like writing an entire song about being bothered"}], "lyrical_crime_highlights": [{"line": "I put good dick all in my kidneys", "crime": "Crimes against anatomy and basic human biology", "sentence": "Mandatory retake of 9th grade health class"}, {"line": "Said my happiness is all of your misery", "crime": "Trying to pass off sadism as a personality trait", "sentence": "Required to watch every feel-good Pixar movie until empathy develops"}, {"line": "She the devil / She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel", "crime": "Rhyming a word with itself and calling it a day (x6 counts)", "sentence": "Write 'I will not be lazy with rhymes' 500 times on a chalkboard"}, {"line": "Fall off what?
